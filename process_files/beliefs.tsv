180	However, FEPROMAS detected a cultural norm of negative stigma attached with receiving food aid, which may explain the disconnect between the high proportion of members who were experiencing moderate food insecurity but who said they did not need any food	Senegal Farmer Networks Respond to COVID-19	Annah Latané, Jean-Michel Voisard, Alice Olive Brower, Jeremiah Ngondi	2021
181	By contrast, Kissal Patim's leaders indicated that even when the enumerators were network agents with trusted relationships, members would respond in the affirmative that they needed food aid if they thought that Kissal Patim might be investing in new programs, even when they had already received aid.	Senegal Farmer Networks Respond to COVID-19	Annah Latané, Jean-Michel Voisard, Alice Olive Brower, Jeremiah Ngondi	2021
182	The majority of households in Saxemi and FEPROMAS indicated that they had borrowed in the form of cash or inkind credit in the pastyear, with most of that credit used to support agricultural production, followed by food purchases.	Senegal Farmer Networks Respond to COVID-19	Annah Latané, Jean-Michel Voisard, Alice Olive Brower, Jeremiah Ngondi	2021
183	They said that because the networks were playing a strong intermediary role for accessing finance, most of their members who borrowed did not perceive that the original source of the credit was the banks.	Senegal Farmer Networks Respond to COVID-19	Annah Latané, Jean-Michel Voisard, Alice Olive Brower, Jeremiah Ngondi	2021
184	Most respondents did not indicate that household food stocks during the winter months would be a constraint, with the exception of members of Kissal Patim, which reflected the higher levels of vulnerability of households in the Casamance region, a post-conflict zone.	Senegal Farmer Networks Respond to COVID-19	Annah Latané, Jean-Michel Voisard, Alice Olive Brower, Jeremiah Ngondi	2021
185	Most households reported shifting their cropping strategy to short-cycle crops (such as cowpea and maize) and favoring cereals and food crops.	Senegal Farmer Networks Respond to COVID-19	Annah Latané, Jean-Michel Voisard, Alice Olive Brower, Jeremiah Ngondi	2021
186	Market gardens were another popular strategy, particularly with farmers in the Entente network.	Senegal Farmer Networks Respond to COVID-19	Annah Latané, Jean-Michel Voisard, Alice Olive Brower, Jeremiah Ngondi	2021
187	Kissal Patim's leaders noted that they were benefiting from engagement with the USAID-funded Feed the Future Kawolor Project as a reason that farmers were pushing into market gardens and horticulture crops; with the Kawolor Project's support, Kissal Patim staff made telephone calls and sent messages to farmers via rural radio stations to produce as much foodstuff as possible in preparation for a potential second wave of the pandemic, while paying attention to household nutrition in the process.

189	However, most households reported not selling livestock, with the exception of male respondents from FEPROMAS; network discussions provided context that fattening sheep is a common side business for men in the Saloum region and particularly where FEPROMAS is active, so when the travel ban was lifted, business picked up.	Senegal Farmer Networks Respond to COVID-19	Annah Latané, Jean-Michel Voisard, Alice Olive Brower, Jeremiah Ngondi	2021
190	In Casamance, networks indicated that it was quite uncommon to sell sheep or goats.	Senegal Farmer Networks Respond to COVID-19	Annah Latané, Jean-Michel Voisard, Alice Olive Brower, Jeremiah Ngondi	2021
191	As an example, Saxemi opted to reserve a portion of the 2019 harvest to respect key commercial contracts while freeing the limited remaining surpluses for internal network households, rather than speculating on the open market.	Senegal Farmer Networks Respond to COVID-19	Annah Latané, Jean-Michel Voisard, Alice Olive Brower, Jeremiah Ngondi	2021
192	Kissal Patim made sure that members could access fertilizer subsidies for the 2020 season but distributed these inputs with the expectation that members would repay the network at the end of the season to rebuild internal capital for subsequent input lending.	Senegal Farmer Networks Respond to COVID-19	Annah Latané, Jean-Michel Voisard, Alice Olive Brower, Jeremiah Ngondi	2021
193	This response contrasts with the prevailing expectation that farmers would rely on negative coping strategies (such as destocking livestock or consuming their seed stocks) to face the COVID-19 shock unless input firms, processors, buyers, and banks took the initiative.	Senegal Farmer Networks Respond to COVID-19	Annah Latané, Jean-Michel Voisard, Alice Olive Brower, Jeremiah Ngondi	2021

296	Ultimately it is hoped that these interventions will play a useful part in fueling an improvement in the livelihoods and food security of the Senegalese people, while improving the lot of women and youth and the environment.	Senegal Agricultural Value Chain Study	Michiel Arnoldus, Kerry Kyd, Pierre Chapusette, Floris van der Pol, Barry Clausen	2019
297	Each Senegalese citizen is estimated to consume 27 kg of onions-largely the Violet de Galmi or other equally spicy varieties.	Senegal Agricultural Value Chain Study	Michiel Arnoldus, Kerry Kyd, Pierre Chapusette, Floris van der Pol, Barry Clausen	2019
298	Local shoppers, it would seem, are willing to pay for quality.	Senegal Agricultural Value Chain Study	Michiel Arnoldus, Kerry Kyd, Pierre Chapusette, Floris van der Pol, Barry Clausen	2019
299	By early February, most farmers from the Senegal River Valley-the largest production area-aim to bring their onions to market.	Senegal Agricultural Value Chain Study	Michiel Arnoldus, Kerry Kyd, Pierre Chapusette, Floris van der Pol, Barry Clausen	2019
300	The dominant onion variety, the Violet de Galmi, is by nature relatively heat tolerant variety.	Senegal Agricultural Value Chain Study	Michiel Arnoldus, Kerry Kyd, Pierre Chapusette, Floris van der Pol, Barry Clausen	2019
301	But these are certainly not preferred by consumers.	Senegal Agricultural Value Chain Study	Michiel Arnoldus, Kerry Kyd, Pierre Chapusette, Floris van der Pol, Barry Clausen	2019
302	Both the producers in the Niayes and along the Senegal River Valley tend to bring their produce to market from March to May.	Senegal Agricultural Value Chain Study	Michiel Arnoldus, Kerry Kyd, Pierre Chapusette, Floris van der Pol, Barry Clausen	2019
303	However, farmers in the onion chain prefer to use Urea for its high nitrogen content.	Senegal Agricultural Value Chain Study	Michiel Arnoldus, Kerry Kyd, Pierre Chapusette, Floris van der Pol, Barry Clausen	2019
304	Industrial producers have a real preference for using these specific wholesalers to market their onions.	Senegal Agricultural Value Chain Study	Michiel Arnoldus, Kerry Kyd, Pierre Chapusette, Floris van der Pol, Barry Clausen	2019
305	APOV organizes especially the area of Podor, the main production area in the country, while APROBAD organises the farmers in the newer areas further down the valley in Dagana.	Senegal Agricultural Value Chain Study	Michiel Arnoldus, Kerry Kyd, Pierre Chapusette, Floris van der Pol, Barry Clausen	2019
306	These activities are currently being supported by the Dutch Association PUM-who hopes to increase the capacity of this organisation.	Senegal Agricultural Value Chain Study	Michiel Arnoldus, Kerry Kyd, Pierre Chapusette, Floris van der Pol, Barry Clausen	2019
307	Along the Senegal River Valley area farmers have a very strong need to cooperate to manage water supplies.	Senegal Agricultural Value Chain Study	Michiel Arnoldus, Kerry Kyd, Pierre Chapusette, Floris van der Pol, Barry Clausen	2019
308	Finally, the large industrial producers have been reluctant to join IPOS.	Senegal Agricultural Value Chain Study	Michiel Arnoldus, Kerry Kyd, Pierre Chapusette, Floris van der Pol, Barry Clausen	2019
309	Most farmers who are not able to self-finance, get financing from traders or personal networks.	Senegal Agricultural Value Chain Study	Michiel Arnoldus, Kerry Kyd, Pierre Chapusette, Floris van der Pol, Barry Clausen	2019
310	The primary focus of farmers in this chain is to get their onion harvest to market as quickly as possible.	Senegal Agricultural Value Chain Study	Michiel Arnoldus, Kerry Kyd, Pierre Chapusette, Floris van der Pol, Barry Clausen	2019
311	Farmers often harvest before the onions have fully matured and dried.	Senegal Agricultural Value Chain Study	Michiel Arnoldus, Kerry Kyd, Pierre Chapusette, Floris van der Pol, Barry Clausen	2019
312	Farmers, especially in the Niayes area, rely on hired migrant labour to harvest their crops.	Senegal Agricultural Value Chain Study	Michiel Arnoldus, Kerry Kyd, Pierre Chapusette, Floris van der Pol, Barry Clausen	2019
313	Along the Senegal River Valley farmers often compete for access to tractors for land preparation, that are usually allocated to tomato growers who are more organised and able to lobby better in this area.	Senegal Agricultural Value Chain Study	Michiel Arnoldus, Kerry Kyd, Pierre Chapusette, Floris van der Pol, Barry Clausen	2019
314	However, storage is said to be inadequate because of the following reasons:	Senegal Agricultural Value Chain Study	Michiel Arnoldus, Kerry Kyd, Pierre Chapusette, Floris van der Pol, Barry Clausen	2019
315	In the hot summer months, some farmers leave their land fallow, preferring to wait for cooler temperatures.	Senegal Agricultural Value Chain Study	Michiel Arnoldus, Kerry Kyd, Pierre Chapusette, Floris van der Pol, Barry Clausen	2019
316	Thirdly, farmers rely heavily on Urea to speed up growth, and lack technical expertise and advice to steer them to quality fertiliser options.	Senegal Agricultural Value Chain Study	Michiel Arnoldus, Kerry Kyd, Pierre Chapusette, Floris van der Pol, Barry Clausen	2019
317	This is a limited local opportunity as shoppers prefer the red onion varieties.	Senegal Agricultural Value Chain Study	Michiel Arnoldus, Kerry Kyd, Pierre Chapusette, Floris van der Pol, Barry Clausen	2019
318	Processing of onions into onion powder has been a very popular idea for several years.	Senegal Agricultural Value Chain Study	Michiel Arnoldus, Kerry Kyd, Pierre Chapusette, Floris van der Pol, Barry Clausen	2019
319	Therefore, most small-scale farmers use secondhand packaging for their onions.	Senegal Agricultural Value Chain Study	Michiel Arnoldus, Kerry Kyd, Pierre Chapusette, Floris van der Pol, Barry Clausen	2019
320	Onions form a cornerstone of Senegalese diets, with demand for this ingredient only expected to grow.	Senegal Agricultural Value Chain Study	Michiel Arnoldus, Kerry Kyd, Pierre Chapusette, Floris van der Pol, Barry Clausen	2019
321	Unsurprisingly, to cater for this demand nearly 22000 households are thought to be involved in onion cultivation alone, with many more involved in marketing and distribution.	Senegal Agricultural Value Chain Study	Michiel Arnoldus, Kerry Kyd, Pierre Chapusette, Floris van der Pol, Barry Clausen	2019
322	A review of the drivers of quality issues in the onion chain also reveals that farmers produce onions with relatively little technical, or financial support.	Senegal Agricultural Value Chain Study	Michiel Arnoldus, Kerry Kyd, Pierre Chapusette, Floris van der Pol, Barry Clausen	2019
323	Finally, women and youth seem to prefer-and thrive an environment that require technical skills and in the case of women attention to detail.	Senegal Agricultural Value Chain Study	Michiel Arnoldus, Kerry Kyd, Pierre Chapusette, Floris van der Pol, Barry Clausen	2019
324	Ultimately it is hoped that these interventions will play a useful part in fueling an improvement in the livelihoods and food security of the Senegalese people, while improving the lot of women and youth and the environment.	Senegal Agricultural Value Chain Study	Michiel Arnoldus, Kerry Kyd, Pierre Chapusette, Floris van der Pol, Barry Clausen	2019
325	In 2020 Senegalese are estimated to consume just 22% of that volume per person.	Senegal Agricultural Value Chain Study	Michiel Arnoldus, Kerry Kyd, Pierre Chapusette, Floris van der Pol, Barry Clausen	2019
326	The quality of imported potatoes is seen as being somewhat better than that of local potatoes, largely because they can be stored for longer periods without rotting.	Senegal Agricultural Value Chain Study	Michiel Arnoldus, Kerry Kyd, Pierre Chapusette, Floris van der Pol, Barry Clausen	2019
327	Bana banas are more traditional traders who take ownership of the product and transport it.	Senegal Agricultural Value Chain Study	Michiel Arnoldus, Kerry Kyd, Pierre Chapusette, Floris van der Pol, Barry Clausen	2019
328	Many of these farmers cooperate with Senegindia, or are a part of their contract farming system.	Senegal Agricultural Value Chain Study	Michiel Arnoldus, Kerry Kyd, Pierre Chapusette, Floris van der Pol, Barry Clausen	2019
329	Potato is the main winter season crop for these farmers, alongside an assortment of vegetables such as cabbage, onions and carrots.	Senegal Agricultural Value Chain Study	Michiel Arnoldus, Kerry Kyd, Pierre Chapusette, Floris van der Pol, Barry Clausen	2019
330	Even on this small scale, potato farming is considered quite profitable, potentially more than onions.	Senegal Agricultural Value Chain Study	Michiel Arnoldus, Kerry Kyd, Pierre Chapusette, Floris van der Pol, Barry Clausen	2019
331	At harvest these farmers employ migrant labour (soughas) who come from Mali, Mauritania or poorer parts of Senegal.	Senegal Agricultural Value Chain Study	Michiel Arnoldus, Kerry Kyd, Pierre Chapusette, Floris van der Pol, Barry Clausen	2019
332	Farmers can relatively easily store potato in a diffused light store (dark traditional storage with good ventilation), for 2-4 months until a next season starts.	Senegal Agricultural Value Chain Study	Michiel Arnoldus, Kerry Kyd, Pierre Chapusette, Floris van der Pol, Barry Clausen	2019
333	In a clever move, Germicopa distributes through one of the more active market gardening professional associations in the Niayes, AUMN.	Senegal Agricultural Value Chain Study	Michiel Arnoldus, Kerry Kyd, Pierre Chapusette, Floris van der Pol, Barry Clausen	2019
334	In general Senegalese shoppers prefer larger sizes of potatoes (consumer research).	Senegal Agricultural Value Chain Study	Michiel Arnoldus, Kerry Kyd, Pierre Chapusette, Floris van der Pol, Barry Clausen	2019
335	But producers prefer smaller production sizes, which allow them to pack potatoes more densely per ha.	Senegal Agricultural Value Chain Study	Michiel Arnoldus, Kerry Kyd, Pierre Chapusette, Floris van der Pol, Barry Clausen	2019
336	Local professional association AUMN for example advises small scale farmers to plant with a 50cm distance between rows.	Senegal Agricultural Value Chain Study	Michiel Arnoldus, Kerry Kyd, Pierre Chapusette, Floris van der Pol, Barry Clausen	2019
337	Senegal value chain study well known seed suppliers in Senegal are Tropicasem, UPGM de Mboro (importing seed Potatoes), Aumn (Association des Unions Maraicher des Niayes) and Germikopa.

339	Small farmers particularly across Africa have a tendency to only use 1/3rd to (1/2) of the recommended dose because of a lack of funds, but this reduces the yields and profitability significantly.	Senegal Agricultural Value Chain Study	Michiel Arnoldus, Kerry Kyd, Pierre Chapusette, Floris van der Pol, Barry Clausen	2019
340	Importers tend to market imported potatoes to wholesalers and semi-wholesalers in Dakar.	Senegal Agricultural Value Chain Study	Michiel Arnoldus, Kerry Kyd, Pierre Chapusette, Floris van der Pol, Barry Clausen	2019

349	Thirdly, farmers rely sometimes on fertilisers from poultry or peanut shells.	Senegal Agricultural Value Chain Study	Michiel Arnoldus, Kerry Kyd, Pierre Chapusette, Floris van der Pol, Barry Clausen	2019
350	Local producers feel that this business specifically is responsible for unfair competition in the potato market.	Senegal Agricultural Value Chain Study	Michiel Arnoldus, Kerry Kyd, Pierre Chapusette, Floris van der Pol, Barry Clausen	2019
351	Naturally all industrial investors across the open field crops are aware of the potential for friction with local communities.	Senegal Agricultural Value Chain Study	Michiel Arnoldus, Kerry Kyd, Pierre Chapusette, Floris van der Pol, Barry Clausen	2019
352	There is some interest in some producers to expand in to potato crisp production for children.	Senegal Agricultural Value Chain Study	Michiel Arnoldus, Kerry Kyd, Pierre Chapusette, Floris van der Pol, Barry Clausen	2019
353	This is especially true as Senegindia is often allowed to sell their potatoes around festivities, which might coincide with small scaler marketing seasons.	Senegal Agricultural Value Chain Study	Michiel Arnoldus, Kerry Kyd, Pierre Chapusette, Floris van der Pol, Barry Clausen	2019
354	In our experience the break-even point is usually around 5 tons per ha, which tends to be the average yield of small scale farmers, going up to 10 - 15 tons for emerging commercial farmers.	Senegal Agricultural Value Chain Study	Michiel Arnoldus, Kerry Kyd, Pierre Chapusette, Floris van der Pol, Barry Clausen	2019
355	In other African countries there tend to be more female farmers involved in potato growing.	Senegal Agricultural Value Chain Study	Michiel Arnoldus, Kerry Kyd, Pierre Chapusette, Floris van der Pol, Barry Clausen	2019
356	To accommodate food safety and to reduce supply chain risks, retailers prefer to source vegetables from a few, vertically integrated suppliers, who can provide reliable supplies of vegetables yearround.	Senegal Agricultural Value Chain Study	Michiel Arnoldus, Kerry Kyd, Pierre Chapusette, Floris van der Pol, Barry Clausen	2019
357	Ultimately it is hoped that these interventions will play a useful part in fueling an improvement in the livelihoods and food security of the Senegalese people, while improving the lot of women and youth and the environment.

359	Green beans are an important vegetable in most of the EU, and one of the most popular across most of the EU.	Senegal Agricultural Value Chain Study	Michiel Arnoldus, Kerry Kyd, Pierre Chapusette, Floris van der Pol, Barry Clausen	2019
360	Southern Europe prefers fine beans which are no wider than 9mm.	Senegal Agricultural Value Chain Study	Michiel Arnoldus, Kerry Kyd, Pierre Chapusette, Floris van der Pol, Barry Clausen	2019
361	Northern European buyers tend to prefer a larger bean that's also wider (>9 in width).	Senegal Agricultural Value Chain Study	Michiel Arnoldus, Kerry Kyd, Pierre Chapusette, Floris van der Pol, Barry Clausen	2019
362	For example, Kenyans now eat green beans fairly often and see it as a part of their regular menu of vegetables.	Senegal Agricultural Value Chain Study	Michiel Arnoldus, Kerry Kyd, Pierre Chapusette, Floris van der Pol, Barry Clausen	2019

364	Some local vegetables such as Okra, peanuts, manioc etc are also grown in this season.	Senegal Agricultural Value Chain Study	Michiel Arnoldus, Kerry Kyd, Pierre Chapusette, Floris van der Pol, Barry Clausen	2019
365	The ambition is for these companies to produce a variety of vegetables for the winter months.	Senegal Agricultural Value Chain Study	Michiel Arnoldus, Kerry Kyd, Pierre Chapusette, Floris van der Pol, Barry Clausen	2019
366	Because these farms cannot sell vegetables or other crops for human consumption on the local market, they tend not to produce anything during the hot and rainy season.	Senegal Agricultural Value Chain Study	Michiel Arnoldus, Kerry Kyd, Pierre Chapusette, Floris van der Pol, Barry Clausen	2019
367	Usually, the farmers focus on vegetables for the local market.	Senegal Agricultural Value Chain Study	Michiel Arnoldus, Kerry Kyd, Pierre Chapusette, Floris van der Pol, Barry Clausen	2019
368	However, subsidies on fertilisers affect the perceived value of fertilisers on the unsubsidised market.	Senegal Agricultural Value Chain Study	Michiel Arnoldus, Kerry Kyd, Pierre Chapusette, Floris van der Pol, Barry Clausen	2019
369	However, as these farmers tend to grow these vegetables as a secondary crop, it's important to consider their membership of other GIE's related to primary crops.	Senegal Agricultural Value Chain Study	Michiel Arnoldus, Kerry Kyd, Pierre Chapusette, Floris van der Pol, Barry Clausen	2019
370	But in Senegal a combination of low appetite for risk and high interest rates as well as low awareness of available products means that most farmers avoid formal credit products.	Senegal Agricultural Value Chain Study	Michiel Arnoldus, Kerry Kyd, Pierre Chapusette, Floris van der Pol, Barry Clausen	2019
371	Senegal Value Chain Study popularity of solar irrigation-and the fact that it makes good business sense-means that this has become an important area of activity for these MFI's.

373	However, Senegal at the moment does not seem to be the preferred location for expansion due to the short production season and high start-up cost that make it difficult to earn back the initial investment.	Senegal Agricultural Value Chain Study	Michiel Arnoldus, Kerry Kyd, Pierre Chapusette, Floris van der Pol, Barry Clausen	2019
374	SAFINA already has one of the largest mango plantations and arguably the best yielding plantation.	Senegal Agricultural Value Chain Study	Michiel Arnoldus, Kerry Kyd, Pierre Chapusette, Floris van der Pol, Barry Clausen	2019
375	In addition, in order to avoid salination and soil degradation it would be better to farm a rainfed sorghum crop in the hot season for silage production, or maize silage with limited supplementary irrigation.	Senegal Agricultural Value Chain Study	Michiel Arnoldus, Kerry Kyd, Pierre Chapusette, Floris van der Pol, Barry Clausen	2019
376	This creates tension between commercial farmers and local communities who see large industrial investors getting access to thousands of hectares of land.	Senegal Agricultural Value Chain Study	Michiel Arnoldus, Kerry Kyd, Pierre Chapusette, Floris van der Pol, Barry Clausen	2019
377	They tend to be more involved in activities in packhouses-where their better attention to detail gives them advantages in sorting of vegetables.	Senegal Agricultural Value Chain Study	Michiel Arnoldus, Kerry Kyd, Pierre Chapusette, Floris van der Pol, Barry Clausen	2019
378	They tend to be hired as tractors drivers, training to provide mechanic services, to manage the irrigation systems etc.	Senegal Agricultural Value Chain Study	Michiel Arnoldus, Kerry Kyd, Pierre Chapusette, Floris van der Pol, Barry Clausen	2019
379	Many Senegalese rely on marine fish for the bulk of the animal protein in their diets.	Senegal Agricultural Value Chain Study	Michiel Arnoldus, Kerry Kyd, Pierre Chapusette, Floris van der Pol, Barry Clausen	2019
380	Eggs and chicken meat are gram for gram the next most affordable animal protein after sardines, which many would consider the national food of Senegal.	Senegal Agricultural Value Chain Study	Michiel Arnoldus, Kerry Kyd, Pierre Chapusette, Floris van der Pol, Barry Clausen	2019

382	Yaboy (sardines), are widely available in local markets and can be bought for 30% of the cost of chicken.	Senegal Agricultural Value Chain Study	Michiel Arnoldus, Kerry Kyd, Pierre Chapusette, Floris van der Pol, Barry Clausen	2019
383	The entire bird is required to feed a family for 1 meal, so birds weighing at least 2.5kg live (2kg plucked) are clearly preferred.	Senegal Agricultural Value Chain Study	Michiel Arnoldus, Kerry Kyd, Pierre Chapusette, Floris van der Pol, Barry Clausen	2019
384	Over 90% of Senegalese purchase poultry from open air markets.	Senegal Agricultural Value Chain Study	Michiel Arnoldus, Kerry Kyd, Pierre Chapusette, Floris van der Pol, Barry Clausen	2019

388	In the informal sector backyard producers use local and broiler breeds of chicken that are fed with local agricultural by products such as maize bran, or sometimes with some improved feed.	Senegal Agricultural Value Chain Study	Michiel Arnoldus, Kerry Kyd, Pierre Chapusette, Floris van der Pol, Barry Clausen	2019
389	Local chickens take about 6 months to grow and are sold for substantially higher prices because they are appreciated for their flavour.	Senegal Agricultural Value Chain Study	Michiel Arnoldus, Kerry Kyd, Pierre Chapusette, Floris van der Pol, Barry Clausen	2019
390	While some grow imported broiler breeds, they are also more likely to producer local chicken.	Senegal Agricultural Value Chain Study	Michiel Arnoldus, Kerry Kyd, Pierre Chapusette, Floris van der Pol, Barry Clausen	2019
391	Small scale farmers are particularly affected by the rainy season and the Tabaski period.	Senegal Agricultural Value Chain Study	Michiel Arnoldus, Kerry Kyd, Pierre Chapusette, Floris van der Pol, Barry Clausen	2019
392	Most commercial farmers have recognised that imported broilers have a higher feed conversion ratio and so make for far more competitive chicken production.	Senegal Agricultural Value Chain Study	Michiel Arnoldus, Kerry Kyd, Pierre Chapusette, Floris van der Pol, Barry Clausen	2019
393	The predominant breed of imported broiler hatching-eggs are Cobb 500 are Hubbard.	Senegal Agricultural Value Chain Study	Michiel Arnoldus, Kerry Kyd, Pierre Chapusette, Floris van der Pol, Barry Clausen	2019

396	Large industrial producers tend to focus on the food services sector or work with traders (bana-banas) who distribute live chickens to the markets.	Senegal Agricultural Value Chain Study	Michiel Arnoldus, Kerry Kyd, Pierre Chapusette, Floris van der Pol, Barry Clausen	2019
397	At the start of the rainy season and Tabaski, the traders are aware that prices of chicken will fall.	Senegal Agricultural Value Chain Study	Michiel Arnoldus, Kerry Kyd, Pierre Chapusette, Floris van der Pol, Barry Clausen	2019
398	The ambition of the fund is to extend coverage to all agricultural producers, especially when they access credit.	Senegal Agricultural Value Chain Study	Michiel Arnoldus, Kerry Kyd, Pierre Chapusette, Floris van der Pol, Barry Clausen	2019
399	"But outside of this top-end segment and the limited food services segment, most Senegalese continue to purchase live chicken, ""sur pied"" from markets and neighbours."	Senegal Agricultural Value Chain Study	Michiel Arnoldus, Kerry Kyd, Pierre Chapusette, Floris van der Pol, Barry Clausen	2019
400	Large commercial producers tend to lock in traders , who are in turn only too happy to deal with a few large, reliable suppliers.	Senegal Agricultural Value Chain Study	Michiel Arnoldus, Kerry Kyd, Pierre Chapusette, Floris van der Pol, Barry Clausen	2019

547	Although there was mass applause for the coup because of the growing disenchantment against the regime of President Taya, the decision by the AU to condemn the unconstitutional change of government is indicative of the strong commitment of the AU to institutionalizing democratic rule.	Elections and Democratic Consolidation in West Africa: Comparative Study of Nigeria and Senegal, 1999-2012	Abiodun Surajudeen Fatai, Suzanne Francis, Abiodun Fatai	2017
548	As noted by Williams (2007: 274) 'the AU was obliged to condemn the coup d'etat in principle, even though it was aware of the significant local support and international sympathy for the coup'.

560	As Boafor-Arthur (2008: 34) argues, 'the common saying in Ghana now is that power to make and unmake government no longer resides in the barrel of the gun but with the thumb of individual voters'.	Elections and Democratic Consolidation in West Africa: Comparative Study of Nigeria and Senegal, 1999-2012	Abiodun Surajudeen Fatai, Suzanne Francis, Abiodun Fatai	2017
561	For example, despite the division in the party for the Independence of Cape Verde (PAICV), leading to the establishment of a new party; the Movement for Democracy (MPD), the elites accepted the uncertain outcome of the 1991 election (Meyns, 2001).	Elections and Democratic Consolidation in West Africa: Comparative Study of Nigeria and Senegal, 1999-2012	Abiodun Surajudeen Fatai, Suzanne Francis, Abiodun Fatai	2017
562	As Gyimah-Boadi (2008: 14) aptly puts it, 'this was significant and unprecedented, the two main parties were convinced that there should be only one candidate, and they both supported him while contesting for spoils in the assembly elections'.	Elections and Democratic Consolidation in West Africa: Comparative Study of Nigeria and Senegal, 1999-2012	Abiodun Surajudeen Fatai, Suzanne Francis, Abiodun Fatai	2017
563	Illustrative of the strong democratic commitment and elite consensus, the military ruler, Mathew Kerekou, of the People's Revolutionary Party of Benin (PRPB) handed over power to the opposition candidate, Nicephero Soglo of the Benin Rebirth Party (BRP) after their defeat in 1991.	Elections and Democratic Consolidation in West Africa: Comparative Study of Nigeria and Senegal, 1999-2012	Abiodun Surajudeen Fatai, Suzanne Francis, Abiodun Fatai	2017
564	After the completion of his second term in 2006, Mathew Kerekou respected the constitutional two-term limit by peacefully handing over power to President Yayi Boni, an independent candidate who won the election with a landslide victory.	Elections and Democratic Consolidation in West Africa: Comparative Study of Nigeria and Senegal, 1999-2012	Abiodun Surajudeen Fatai, Suzanne Francis, Abiodun Fatai	2017
565	President Mathew Kerekou did not only respect the constitutional clauses, he also demonstrated to the political elites a democratic political culture, which speaks to respect for the democratic rule of law and constitutionalism.	Elections and Democratic Consolidation in West Africa: Comparative Study of Nigeria and Senegal, 1999-2012	Abiodun Surajudeen Fatai, Suzanne Francis, Abiodun Fatai	2017
566	Even so, the increasing democratic reversals in a host of other states, such as Niger, Togo, Cote d'lvoire, Guinea-Bissau, Mauritania, and Guinea raises a challenge for the consolidation of democracy in West Africa where only 5 out of the 16 countries are deemed to have consolidated their democracies.	Elections and Democratic Consolidation in West Africa: Comparative Study of Nigeria and Senegal, 1999-2012	Abiodun Surajudeen Fatai, Suzanne Francis, Abiodun Fatai	2017
567	With the exception of the 2011 elections, which was seen as an improvement when (compared to the 2003 and 2007 elections), nearly all elections in Nigeria have been characterized by serious irregularities and violence.

568	Having promised to return the country back to civilian rule, President Olusegun Obasanjo honoured his commitment by handing power over to the elected civilian regime of Shehu Shagari in 1979 (Kura, 2009).

569	As soon as he became the head of state through the 1983 military coup which displaced Major General Muhammadu Buhari and Tunde Idiagbon, he gave assurances that his government 'would not remain in power a day longer than necessary' and that his regime 'would be the last military regime in Nigeria' (Obi, 2000:74).	Elections and Democratic Consolidation in West Africa: Comparative Study of Nigeria and Senegal, 1999-2012	Abiodun Surajudeen Fatai, Suzanne Francis, Abiodun Fatai	2017
570	Although the selection of Shonekan to head the Interim Government was seen as an attempt to pacify the Yoruba (given that he came from the region where MKO Abiola, the winner of the June 12 elections is from), the decision to hand over to an Interim and not a substantive government was suggestive of an attempt to rule from afar.	Elections and Democratic Consolidation in West Africa: Comparative Study of Nigeria and Senegal, 1999-2012	Abiodun Surajudeen Fatai, Suzanne Francis, Abiodun Fatai	2017
571	President Obasanjo was seen as a committed democrat who would advance the democratic course of Nigeria.	Elections and Democratic Consolidation in West Africa: Comparative Study of Nigeria and Senegal, 1999-2012	Abiodun Surajudeen Fatai, Suzanne Francis, Abiodun Fatai	2017
572	For example, while the All People Party has been seen as the party of the Ibo of the South-East, the AD has been associated with the Yoruba people of the South-West.	Elections and Democratic Consolidation in West Africa: Comparative Study of Nigeria and Senegal, 1999-2012	Abiodun Surajudeen Fatai, Suzanne Francis, Abiodun Fatai	2017
573	This was why Ezeife, a prominent politician in Nigeria, asserted provocatively that, Nigerian political elite 'are not better than group of armed robbers, who have agreed on how to share loots' (Vanguard, 7 September 1998).	Elections and Democratic Consolidation in West Africa: Comparative Study of Nigeria and Senegal, 1999-2012	Abiodun Surajudeen Fatai, Suzanne Francis, Abiodun Fatai	2017
574	Of the three political parties, Nigerians were seemingly comfortable with the AD, given its emphasis on the reformation of the country's federalist balance, which is central to the national question in the country129, whereas the other two major parties, the PDP and the APP, are 'loose coalitions of centrists and conservatist professional politicians, businessmen, and retired military officers' (Obi, 2000: 8).	Elections and Democratic Consolidation in West Africa: Comparative Study of Nigeria and Senegal, 1999-2012	Abiodun Surajudeen Fatai, Suzanne Francis, Abiodun Fatai	2017
575	For the Presidential election, the AD and the APP formed an alliance and adopted a consensus candidate, Chief Olu Falae, who was a former Secretary to the Federal Government of Nigeria, while the PDP adopted Olusegun Obasanjo, a retired military general of the Nigerian army.	Elections and Democratic Consolidation in West Africa: Comparative Study of Nigeria and Senegal, 1999-2012	Abiodun Surajudeen Fatai, Suzanne Francis, Abiodun Fatai	2017
576	The election was held on the 27th of February, 1999 and Olusegun Obasanjo of the PDP won the Presidential elections by a wide margin, polling 18, 738,154 votes (about 62.78 per cent of the total votes) against the runner-up's Chief Olu Falae 11,110.287 (about 37.22 per cent) (Akinboboye, 1999).	Elections and Democratic Consolidation in West Africa: Comparative Study of Nigeria and Senegal, 1999-2012	Abiodun Surajudeen Fatai, Suzanne Francis, Abiodun Fatai	2017
577	Despite the dissatisfaction of the TMG with the elections, it could not demand the cancellation of the election and a call for fresh elections (Oshodi, 2007).	Elections and Democratic Consolidation in West Africa: Comparative Study of Nigeria and Senegal, 1999-2012	Abiodun Surajudeen Fatai, Suzanne Francis, Abiodun Fatai	2017
578	The subversion of constitutional and institutional processes explains the prevalence of electoral fraud and violence as a dominant phenomenon of politics in Nigeria, especially in the 2003 and 2007 elections, deemed to be the worst elections in the democratization history of the country.	Elections and Democratic Consolidation in West Africa: Comparative Study of Nigeria and Senegal, 1999-2012	Abiodun Surajudeen Fatai, Suzanne Francis, Abiodun Fatai	2017
579	"More significantly, the PDP has been regarded as a party ""of army arrangement"" (Tell January 11, 1999: 27)."	Elections and Democratic Consolidation in West Africa: Comparative Study of Nigeria and Senegal, 1999-2012	Abiodun Surajudeen Fatai, Suzanne Francis, Abiodun Fatai	2017
580	Indeed, Nigeria saw the 2003 elections as a chance to deepen their nascent democratization experience.	Elections and Democratic Consolidation in West Africa: Comparative Study of Nigeria and Senegal, 1999-2012	Abiodun Surajudeen Fatai, Suzanne Francis, Abiodun Fatai	2017
581	As a result, the bill received a lot of disapproval from the major stakeholders, especially opposition political parties and civil society organisations.	Elections and Democratic Consolidation in West Africa: Comparative Study of Nigeria and Senegal, 1999-2012	Abiodun Surajudeen Fatai, Suzanne Francis, Abiodun Fatai	2017
582	Notwithstanding, the issue raises concern about, and some degree of suspicion against the ruling party and the INEC in the 2003 electoral process, especially as narrow minded interest dictated the passage of the bill rather than sincere commitment to the reform of the electoral process (Agbaje and Adejumobi, 2006).	Elections and Democratic Consolidation in West Africa: Comparative Study of Nigeria and Senegal, 1999-2012	Abiodun Surajudeen Fatai, Suzanne Francis, Abiodun Fatai	2017
583	Moreover, as claimed by a Lagos based politician 'the political atmosphere was charged as many voters were afraid to vote in the 2003 elections owing to flying reports of political violence and assassinations which increased in the period leading to the elections'142.	Elections and Democratic Consolidation in West Africa: Comparative Study of Nigeria and Senegal, 1999-2012	Abiodun Surajudeen Fatai, Suzanne Francis, Abiodun Fatai	2017
584	According to Human Right Watch report (2003:15), a famous member of the Nigerian Bar Association, Bernabas Igwe, was murdered in Anambra State in September 2002, for urging the Governor to resign due to his inability to pay the salaries of civil servants (HRW, 2003).	Elections and Democratic Consolidation in West Africa: Comparative Study of Nigeria and Senegal, 1999-2012	Abiodun Surajudeen Fatai, Suzanne Francis, Abiodun Fatai	2017
585	In another high profile political assassination, the chairman of the All Nigeria People's Party (ANPP), Harry Marshall, was gruesomely murdered in Abuja (the capital city of Nigeria) for criticizing them as being autocratic in the governance style of the ruling People's Democratic Party (PDP) (HRM, 2003: 15).	Elections and Democratic Consolidation in West Africa: Comparative Study of Nigeria and Senegal, 1999-2012	Abiodun Surajudeen Fatai, Suzanne Francis, Abiodun Fatai	2017
586	Significantly, the two candidates were former military heads of state and were seen as former military juggernauts; capable of giving Nigeria's democratic project a sense of direction.	Elections and Democratic Consolidation in West Africa: Comparative Study of Nigeria and Senegal, 1999-2012	Abiodun Surajudeen Fatai, Suzanne Francis, Abiodun Fatai	2017
587	In the case of General Buhari, he was seen as an anti-corruption crusader, given his activities as the former head of state between 1983 and 1985.	Elections and Democratic Consolidation in West Africa: Comparative Study of Nigeria and Senegal, 1999-2012	Abiodun Surajudeen Fatai, Suzanne Francis, Abiodun Fatai	2017
588	The closest to President Obasanjo in that election was Gen Muhammadu Buhari who polled 12,710,022 which is about 31.19 percent of the entire votes.	Elections and Democratic Consolidation in West Africa: Comparative Study of Nigeria and Senegal, 1999-2012	Abiodun Surajudeen Fatai, Suzanne Francis, Abiodun Fatai	2017
589	The voters wanted their votes to determine the winner of elections, the political class wanted to corrupt the process and rig their way into elective office.	Elections and Democratic Consolidation in West Africa: Comparative Study of Nigeria and Senegal, 1999-2012	Abiodun Surajudeen Fatai, Suzanne Francis, Abiodun Fatai	2017
590	For example, the former Deputy Governor of Osun State between 2003 and 2007, a member of the People Democratic Party (PDP), asserted that, 'I can tell you frankly the election was full of mass rigging.	Elections and Democratic Consolidation in West Africa: Comparative Study of Nigeria and Senegal, 1999-2012	Abiodun Surajudeen Fatai, Suzanne Francis, Abiodun Fatai	2017
591	Although, the PDP was the largest beneficiary of the fraudulent electoral process, they all are, according to TMG, a 'bunch of electoral fraudsters that do not believe in elections as a means and mechanism of leadership changes' (TMG, 2004:3).	Elections and Democratic Consolidation in West Africa: Comparative Study of Nigeria and Senegal, 1999-2012	Abiodun Surajudeen Fatai, Suzanne Francis, Abiodun Fatai	2017
592	For example, Human Rights Watch reported the case of a chairman of the local chapter of PDP in Port Harcourt, (southern part of Nigeria), who informed a human rights activist without any fear 'of how PDP had distributed guns in the area to thugs in readiness for the 2003 elections' (HRW, 2003:15).	Elections and Democratic Consolidation in West Africa: Comparative Study of Nigeria and Senegal, 1999-2012	Abiodun Surajudeen Fatai, Suzanne Francis, Abiodun Fatai	2017
593	Considering the flawed and controversial nature of the 1999 and 2003 elections, the 2007 general election was seen as a defining moment in the democratic history of Nigeria.	Elections and Democratic Consolidation in West Africa: Comparative Study of Nigeria and Senegal, 1999-2012	Abiodun Surajudeen Fatai, Suzanne Francis, Abiodun Fatai	2017
594	At the end of the registration process, the INEC was expected to provide evidence according to the 2006 Electoral Act by making the voters' register available to the Nigerian public.	Elections and Democratic Consolidation in West Africa: Comparative Study of Nigeria and Senegal, 1999-2012	Abiodun Surajudeen Fatai, Suzanne Francis, Abiodun Fatai	2017
595	While the inadequacy of supply of the machines became an issue as many people remained unregistered, there were confirmed reports that revealed that some of the INEC DDCM were found in the premises of one Lamidi Adedibu, a prominent PDP politician in Oyo State (Ibrahim and Ibeanu, 2009).	Elections and Democratic Consolidation in West Africa: Comparative Study of Nigeria and Senegal, 1999-2012	Abiodun Surajudeen Fatai, Suzanne Francis, Abiodun Fatai	2017
596	According to Kwaja (2008: 3), 'six DDCM machines were found in possession of Alhaji Lamidi Adedibu, the most influential politician in Ibadan, Oyo State where he was illegally registering both qualified and under-aged people'.	Elections and Democratic Consolidation in West Africa: Comparative Study of Nigeria and Senegal, 1999-2012	Abiodun Surajudeen Fatai, Suzanne Francis, Abiodun Fatai	2017
597	According to the communique signed by the Arewa Constitutive Forum (ACF)147, a group of prominent Northern leaders in Nigeria, 'we shared in the grave concern and trepidation expressed nationwide by respected and knowledgeable persons and organizations and indeed the general public about the inadequacy of the arrangement being made for the 2007 general elections' (Sunday Punch, 15 October 2006: 14).	Elections and Democratic Consolidation in West Africa: Comparative Study of Nigeria and Senegal, 1999-2012	Abiodun Surajudeen Fatai, Suzanne Francis, Abiodun Fatai	2017
598	Realizing the implication of power extension against the consolidation of the country's nascent democracy, a coalition of civil society and political parties mobilized and mounted pressure on the elected representatives, who were expected to approve the constitutional changes.	Elections and Democratic Consolidation in West Africa: Comparative Study of Nigeria and Senegal, 1999-2012	Abiodun Surajudeen Fatai, Suzanne Francis, Abiodun Fatai	2017
599	Thus, Obasanjo viewed the 2007 elections as a 'matter of life and death for the PDP and Nigeria' (Tenuche, 2009: 2).	Elections and Democratic Consolidation in West Africa: Comparative Study of Nigeria and Senegal, 1999-2012	Abiodun Surajudeen Fatai, Suzanne Francis, Abiodun Fatai	2017
600	In similar comments, President, Obasanjo said, 'it would be a calamity for Nigerians if the PDP lost the 2007 elections; no PDP, no Nigeria' (Tenuche, 2009:5).	Elections and Democratic Consolidation in West Africa: Comparative Study of Nigeria and Senegal, 1999-2012	Abiodun Surajudeen Fatai, Suzanne Francis, Abiodun Fatai	2017
601	For example, Mallam Isa Yaguda, the former Minister of Aviation and key member of the PDP, defected to the All Nigerian Peoples Party (ANPP) prior to the 2007 elections due to his dissatisfaction with the conduct of the party primary in which he was tactically replaced as the candidate of the party(Irikpen, 2010).	Elections and Democratic Consolidation in West Africa: Comparative Study of Nigeria and Senegal, 1999-2012	Abiodun Surajudeen Fatai, Suzanne Francis, Abiodun Fatai	2017
602	In another worrying scenario, the PDP National Working Committee overruled the decision of the state executive of the party to conduct primaries by imposing a former Governor of the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN), Professor Chukwuma Soludo as its candidate (see, Information Nigeria, 2010).	Elections and Democratic Consolidation in West Africa: Comparative Study of Nigeria and Senegal, 1999-2012	Abiodun Surajudeen Fatai, Suzanne Francis, Abiodun Fatai	2017
603	This move was seen by other aspirants as lack of party discipline and violation of internal democracy.	Elections and Democratic Consolidation in West Africa: Comparative Study of Nigeria and Senegal, 1999-2012	Abiodun Surajudeen Fatai, Suzanne Francis, Abiodun Fatai	2017
604	It is when they saw that the party is popular that they were attracted to it and we don't expect them to come and hijack the party because of their dirty money (Olarinmoye 2011 cf.	Elections and Democratic Consolidation in West Africa: Comparative Study of Nigeria and Senegal, 1999-2012	Abiodun Surajudeen Fatai, Suzanne Francis, Abiodun Fatai	2017

683	Initially, CENA was seen as autonomous electoral management body, but the continuation of elections as a state project compromised the autonomy of the commission.

684	Under Maurice Iwu, a professor of Pharmacy whom Obasanjo had nominated for the Chairman's post in 2005, INEC not only helped the presidents and hampered his foes, but also turned a hostile eye on foreign elections observers and domestic monitors alike.	Elections and Democratic Consolidation in West Africa: Comparative Study of Nigeria and Senegal, 1999-2012	Abiodun Surajudeen Fatai, Suzanne Francis, Abiodun Fatai	2017
685	Although, the role of CENA in ensuring credible electoral process have been acknowledged in Senegal, the commission's failure to prevent the postponement of the presidential and legislative elections against the provision of the electoral code in 2007 has been seen by the opposition parties as justifying their lack of trust	Elections and Democratic Consolidation in West Africa: Comparative Study of Nigeria and Senegal, 1999-2012	Abiodun Surajudeen Fatai, Suzanne Francis, Abiodun Fatai	2017
686	In several other instances many of them are expecting to benefit from the selection item team who are likely to protect their interest during the electoral process.256 This scenario is the same with Senegal where the parliament are powerless in the appointment of electoral management body since such appointment is not functional on their approval as the Nigerian case suggests.	Elections and Democratic Consolidation in West Africa: Comparative Study of Nigeria and Senegal, 1999-2012	Abiodun Surajudeen Fatai, Suzanne Francis, Abiodun Fatai	2017
687	Notwithstanding its mode of appointment, CENA in Senegal has maintained some measurable degree of professionalism and has refused to be manipulated, because of the perception that they are accountable to the public, rather than the president or national	Elections and Democratic Consolidation in West Africa: Comparative Study of Nigeria and Senegal, 1999-2012	Abiodun Surajudeen Fatai, Suzanne Francis, Abiodun Fatai	2017
688	For example, the Afrobarometer which studied the perception of Nigeria in relation to trust on INEC, concluded that 58 percent of the electorate believe the commission has been very poor in the management of elections in Nigeria (Afrobarometer, 2009).	Elections and Democratic Consolidation in West Africa: Comparative Study of Nigeria and Senegal, 1999-2012	Abiodun Surajudeen Fatai, Suzanne Francis, Abiodun Fatai	2017
689	The simple reason for this perception is that INEC has been largely partial and incapable of conducting credible elections as witnessed in the 2003 and 2007 elections, in which election was perverted in the interest of the ruling party in Nigeria.	Elections and Democratic Consolidation in West Africa: Comparative Study of Nigeria and Senegal, 1999-2012	Abiodun Surajudeen Fatai, Suzanne Francis, Abiodun Fatai	2017
690	According to report of the Afrobarometer in 2012, '65 percent have trust in the electoral management commission of Senegal' (Afrobarometer, 2012).	Elections and Democratic Consolidation in West Africa: Comparative Study of Nigeria and Senegal, 1999-2012	Abiodun Surajudeen Fatai, Suzanne Francis, Abiodun Fatai	2017
691	As the director of CENCOD, a leading civil society organization in Nigeria argues, 'most political parties in Nigeria are largely informed by political expediencies, they are fragmented and ideologically porous, they are little to the left and little to the right, without a clear-cut ideological leaning and progressive undertakings, they are not a good vehicle for democratic development'281.	Elections and Democratic Consolidation in West Africa: Comparative Study of Nigeria and Senegal, 1999-2012	Abiodun Surajudeen Fatai, Suzanne Francis, Abiodun Fatai	2017
692	This is not a coincidence, because the earlier parties formed during the first republic in Nigeria were more interested in maintaining their regional strongholds rather than having national control (Onuoha, 2003).	Elections and Democratic Consolidation in West Africa: Comparative Study of Nigeria and Senegal, 1999-2012	Abiodun Surajudeen Fatai, Suzanne Francis, Abiodun Fatai	2017
693	In Nigeria, political Godfathers, according to Agbaje & Adejumobi (2006: 40), are 'political barons who deploy vast array of resources, financial and political contract and networks and even traditional social capital, to support their preferred candidates, who are expected to do their bidding in return'.	Elections and Democratic Consolidation in West Africa: Comparative Study of Nigeria and Senegal, 1999-2012	Abiodun Surajudeen Fatai, Suzanne Francis, Abiodun Fatai	2017
694	Similarly, Rashidi Ladoja, the former Governor of Oyo state, enjoyed the support of the strongman of Ibadan politics, Lamidi Adedibu, as his acclaimed Godfather before winning the 2003 governorship elections.	Elections and Democratic Consolidation in West Africa: Comparative Study of Nigeria and Senegal, 1999-2012	Abiodun Surajudeen Fatai, Suzanne Francis, Abiodun Fatai	2017
695	Due to this personality cult woven around political parties with its prevailing neo-patrimonial tendency, it is always difficult to extend alliance to other parties, as electoral competition is seen as orbit of battle ground, where the winner take all.	Elections and Democratic Consolidation in West Africa: Comparative Study of Nigeria and Senegal, 1999-2012	Abiodun Surajudeen Fatai, Suzanne Francis, Abiodun Fatai	2017
696	The tendency of parties to defect as a strategy of patronage negotiation has reduced opposition coalitions to fragility and unpredictability in Senegal.	Elections and Democratic Consolidation in West Africa: Comparative Study of Nigeria and Senegal, 1999-2012	Abiodun Surajudeen Fatai, Suzanne Francis, Abiodun Fatai	2017
697	This has made it difficult for the opposition parties to mobilise around a coalition, since parties are not willing to subsume their ethnic identity and regional colouration around a national political party which could be attained through coalition building.	Elections and Democratic Consolidation in West Africa: Comparative Study of Nigeria and Senegal, 1999-2012	Abiodun Surajudeen Fatai, Suzanne Francis, Abiodun Fatai	2017
698	While the NNA was keen on national unity, the conviction of UPGA was to restructure the federation with a view to breaking the Northern hegemony which always undermine regional development (Osaghae, 1998).	Elections and Democratic Consolidation in West Africa: Comparative Study of Nigeria and Senegal, 1999-2012	Abiodun Surajudeen Fatai, Suzanne Francis, Abiodun Fatai	2017
699	The belief was that the election was manipulated by the ruling NPC to favour the coalition which it belong to (Ikelegbe, 1995).	Elections and Democratic Consolidation in West Africa: Comparative Study of Nigeria and Senegal, 1999-2012	Abiodun Surajudeen Fatai, Suzanne Francis, Abiodun Fatai	2017
700	As argued by a prominent member of civil society organization in Senegal, the management of elections and observation are seen as part of the administration of the state.	Elections and Democratic Consolidation in West Africa: Comparative Study of Nigeria and Senegal, 1999-2012	Abiodun Surajudeen Fatai, Suzanne Francis, Abiodun Fatai	2017
701	The voters wanted their votes to determine the winner of elections, the political class wanted to corrupt the process and rig their way into elective office.	Elections and Democratic Consolidation in West Africa: Comparative Study of Nigeria and Senegal, 1999-2012	Abiodun Surajudeen Fatai, Suzanne Francis, Abiodun Fatai	2017
702	We said we were observers, and they retorted that they did not believe in or recognize observers.	Elections and Democratic Consolidation in West Africa: Comparative Study of Nigeria and Senegal, 1999-2012	Abiodun Surajudeen Fatai, Suzanne Francis, Abiodun Fatai	2017
703	They said we were sent by Asiwaju Bola Tinubu (an AC leader), that we were all from Lagos, We showed them our INEC registration, our personal identity cards, where we worked and all that, but they wouldn't have any of that.	Elections and Democratic Consolidation in West Africa: Comparative Study of Nigeria and Senegal, 1999-2012	Abiodun Surajudeen Fatai, Suzanne Francis, Abiodun Fatai	2017
704	For example, the decision of President Wade's to accuse his former Prime Minister; Idrissa Seck of corruption because of his interest in the presidential race has been seen as persecution of opposition figure (Kelly, 2012) The political succession battle between Idrissa Seck and Abdoulaye Wade, who is interested in installing his son Karim Wade as president to ensure that he personalise power has continue to generate tension within the PDS camp.	Elections and Democratic Consolidation in West Africa: Comparative Study of Nigeria and Senegal, 1999-2012	Abiodun Surajudeen Fatai, Suzanne Francis, Abiodun Fatai	2017
705	Although, a general belief was that Seck would succeed Wade as his number two after the expiration of his tenure.	Elections and Democratic Consolidation in West Africa: Comparative Study of Nigeria and Senegal, 1999-2012	Abiodun Surajudeen Fatai, Suzanne Francis, Abiodun Fatai	2017
706	By demanding accountability from Karim, Macky Sall was deemed to have disrespected the President by not informing him before taking step to hold his son to accountability.	Elections and Democratic Consolidation in West Africa: Comparative Study of Nigeria and Senegal, 1999-2012	Abiodun Surajudeen Fatai, Suzanne Francis, Abiodun Fatai	2017
707	Both Seck and Macky are seen as potential competitors and the allegation of accountability is seen as an attempt to rub-offthe credibility of Karim309.	Elections and Democratic Consolidation in West Africa: Comparative Study of Nigeria and Senegal, 1999-2012	Abiodun Surajudeen Fatai, Suzanne Francis, Abiodun Fatai	2017
708	According to Ogunsanwo (2003:16) 'mere subterfuge of manipulating the party lists submitted to INEC in Abuja and replacing the names on the original list, victory was declared for some individuals.	Elections and Democratic Consolidation in West Africa: Comparative Study of Nigeria and Senegal, 1999-2012	Abiodun Surajudeen Fatai, Suzanne Francis, Abiodun Fatai	2017
709	Following the collapse of the agenda, Obasanjo became vindictive as he persecuted many state Governors who failed to support his ambition (ICG, 2007).	Elections and Democratic Consolidation in West Africa: Comparative Study of Nigeria and Senegal, 1999-2012	Abiodun Surajudeen Fatai, Suzanne Francis, Abiodun Fatai	2017
710	Another example of the violation of civil and political liberty was the outbreak of political violence and assassination meant to intimidate major members of the opposition whose presence was seen as a threat to the domination of the ruling party.	Elections and Democratic Consolidation in West Africa: Comparative Study of Nigeria and Senegal, 1999-2012	Abiodun Surajudeen Fatai, Suzanne Francis, Abiodun Fatai	2017
711	This explains why both countries have been said to be un-consolidating democracy, as the repudiation of democratic freedom by incumbent regime has undermined the widening of the democratic space.	Elections and Democratic Consolidation in West Africa: Comparative Study of Nigeria and Senegal, 1999-2012	Abiodun Surajudeen Fatai, Suzanne Francis, Abiodun Fatai	2017
712	Indeed, the development of an independent media has been seen as major incentive for freedom and democracy (Gellar, 2005; Omotola, 2009; Akinwale, 2010).	Elections and Democratic Consolidation in West Africa: Comparative Study of Nigeria and Senegal, 1999-2012	Abiodun Surajudeen Fatai, Suzanne Francis, Abiodun Fatai	2017
713	The former president was not interested in strengthening democracy; rather his preference was to	Elections and Democratic Consolidation in West Africa: Comparative Study of Nigeria and Senegal, 1999-2012	Abiodun Surajudeen Fatai, Suzanne Francis, Abiodun Fatai	2017
714	The only reason adduced by the minister was that the Sud Correspondence granted an interview with a perceived rebel leader who is against the government of President Wade (Mbow, 2008; Sarr, 2012).	Elections and Democratic Consolidation in West Africa: Comparative Study of Nigeria and Senegal, 1999-2012	Abiodun Surajudeen Fatai, Suzanne Francis, Abiodun Fatai	2017
715	In that editorial, the legitimacy of President Wade was called to questions, due largely to the fact that he was becoming unpopular among the Senegalese people who voted him into office in 2000.	Elections and Democratic Consolidation in West Africa: Comparative Study of Nigeria and Senegal, 1999-2012	Abiodun Surajudeen Fatai, Suzanne Francis, Abiodun Fatai	2017
716	In another crackdown, SSS in 2007 invaded the same media office for airing a documentary titled 'Nigeria's political development' which was seen as an indictment of the government for the flawed and manipulated 2007 elections.	Elections and Democratic Consolidation in West Africa: Comparative Study of Nigeria and Senegal, 1999-2012	Abiodun Surajudeen Fatai, Suzanne Francis, Abiodun Fatai	2017
717	As summed by the editorial of Punch newspaper in Nigeria, It is sad that while international standards, which allow journalists to perform their duties without any hindrance, are respected even at war fronts, Nigerian journalists and media houses face intimidation and harassment on a daily basis at home (The Punch, 2008:14).	Elections and Democratic Consolidation in West Africa: Comparative Study of Nigeria and Senegal, 1999-2012	Abiodun Surajudeen Fatai, Suzanne Francis, Abiodun Fatai	2017
718	The excessive use of state power by the president or Isoumuna (2011) 'imperial presidency' has promoted the tendency of incumbent president to manipulate state institutions, especially the police and the SSS in bringing the state under their tight control314.	Elections and Democratic Consolidation in West Africa: Comparative Study of Nigeria and Senegal, 1999-2012	Abiodun Surajudeen Fatai, Suzanne Francis, Abiodun Fatai	2017
719	This attitude no doubt deny the opposition the opportunity to win elections on a competitive level, they also emasculate the prospect of consolidating democracy.	Elections and Democratic Consolidation in West Africa: Comparative Study of Nigeria and Senegal, 1999-2012	Abiodun Surajudeen Fatai, Suzanne Francis, Abiodun Fatai	2017
720	Instead of aligning with the PS due to their majority, President Wade chose to 'get rid of the old tenant' (Khadre-Lo, 2005: 225) in the parliament by organising a referendum that led to the dissolution of the National Assembly.	Elections and Democratic Consolidation in West Africa: Comparative Study of Nigeria and Senegal, 1999-2012	Abiodun Surajudeen Fatai, Suzanne Francis, Abiodun Fatai	2017
721	This decision was applauded by the Senegaleses, and was seen as attempt to strengthen term limits which have not been streamlined since the emergence of constitutional democracy in the country.	Elections and Democratic Consolidation in West Africa: Comparative Study of Nigeria and Senegal, 1999-2012	Abiodun Surajudeen Fatai, Suzanne Francis, Abiodun Fatai	2017
722	While such clauses indicates personalization of power, popular opinion has it that Wade was trying to create a dynasty in which his son Karim has been positioned to take over.	Elections and Democratic Consolidation in West Africa: Comparative Study of Nigeria and Senegal, 1999-2012	Abiodun Surajudeen Fatai, Suzanne Francis, Abiodun Fatai	2017
723	Karim Wade was by 2012 the commander of four of the government's most important ministerial portfolios, earning him the local nickname of Minister of the Heaven and Earth.	Elections and Democratic Consolidation in West Africa: Comparative Study of Nigeria and Senegal, 1999-2012	Abiodun Surajudeen Fatai, Suzanne Francis, Abiodun Fatai	2017
724	The tendency of incumbent elites to controversially revise the constitution in an attempt to perpetuate power has been the growing concern in the consolidation of democracy in West.	Elections and Democratic Consolidation in West Africa: Comparative Study of Nigeria and Senegal, 1999-2012	Abiodun Surajudeen Fatai, Suzanne Francis, Abiodun Fatai	2017
725	A faction loyal to Lamidi Adedibu -who happened to be one of the foot soldiers of President Obasanjo and PDP-with the support of President Obasanjo, ensured that the governor was removed from office324.	Elections and Democratic Consolidation in West Africa: Comparative Study of Nigeria and Senegal, 1999-2012	Abiodun Surajudeen Fatai, Suzanne Francis, Abiodun Fatai	2017
726	President Obasanjo's attitude did not only indicate intolerance to political opposition, but showed also a strong confirmation of his affront against the rule of law and constitutionalism by consistently refusing to obey court order.	Elections and Democratic Consolidation in West Africa: Comparative Study of Nigeria and Senegal, 1999-2012	Abiodun Surajudeen Fatai, Suzanne Francis, Abiodun Fatai	2017
727	Agbakoba (2008: 2) summed up the attitude of President Obasanjo as 'an imperial president326 that has little regard for the rule of law and constitutional rule'.	Elections and Democratic Consolidation in West Africa: Comparative Study of Nigeria and Senegal, 1999-2012	Abiodun Surajudeen Fatai, Suzanne Francis, Abiodun Fatai	2017
728	Given the excessive power vested in the institution of the presidency in many presidential systems of government in Africa, they did not only 'breach the intent and spirit of the law' (Khadre-Lo, 2005: 225), they also viewed themselves as 'divine-right president who conceives the state as monarchy without limits' (Mbow, 2008:158).	Elections and Democratic Consolidation in West Africa: Comparative Study of Nigeria and Senegal, 1999-2012	Abiodun Surajudeen Fatai, Suzanne Francis, Abiodun Fatai	2017
729	Similarly, African Presidents have developed a scorn for term limit, especially as the notion of father of the nation had become the dominant slogan in many countries in Africa.	Elections and Democratic Consolidation in West Africa: Comparative Study of Nigeria and Senegal, 1999-2012	Abiodun Surajudeen Fatai, Suzanne Francis, Abiodun Fatai	2017
730	Yet, strong evidences have suggested that since the emergence of democratization, many African leaders are willing to vacate surrender power against the initial experience of the early period of independence where a one party ideology has been the reason why many presidents have chosen to stay in power (Fombad &Inegbedion, 2010).	Elections and Democratic Consolidation in West Africa: Comparative Study of Nigeria and Senegal, 1999-2012	Abiodun Surajudeen Fatai, Suzanne Francis, Abiodun Fatai	2017
731	In the same direction, former military ruler, Mathew Kerekou of Benin, not only completed the transition programme, but also peacefully respected the two terms limit after the expiration of his tenure in office.	Elections and Democratic Consolidation in West Africa: Comparative Study of Nigeria and Senegal, 1999-2012	Abiodun Surajudeen Fatai, Suzanne Francis, Abiodun Fatai	2017
732	Furthermore, Miguel Travoada of Sao Tome and Principe and Alpha Oumar Konte of Mali also followed the path of honour, by handing over power to democratically elected regimes to also show their commitment to democratic rule (Fombad and Inegbedion, 2010).	Elections and Democratic Consolidation in West Africa: Comparative Study of Nigeria and Senegal, 1999-2012	Abiodun Surajudeen Fatai, Suzanne Francis, Abiodun Fatai	2017
733	A classic example of this attitude is the statement credited to Senegalese president, Abdoulaye Wade when he averred that 'I take back what I said, I will extend my power' (Maa waxoon waxeet in Wolof)329.	Elections and Democratic Consolidation in West Africa: Comparative Study of Nigeria and Senegal, 1999-2012	Abiodun Surajudeen Fatai, Suzanne Francis, Abiodun Fatai	2017
734	Stakeholders were sceptical about President Obasanjo's decision to hold the conference, given that he had initially condemned the idea on the basis that there cannot be two sovereigns especially that the National Assembly is already constituted331 Significantly, rather than discuss national problems for which the conference was meant, the foremost issue on the agenda of the conference was the review of term limit (Political Reform Conference, 2005).	Elections and Democratic Consolidation in West Africa: Comparative Study of Nigeria and Senegal, 1999-2012	Abiodun Surajudeen Fatai, Suzanne Francis, Abiodun Fatai	2017
735	Despite the growing resentment and campaign against the third term by the opposition political parties and CSOs, President Obasanjo and his followers tried to influence the National Assembly, offering bribes to some of its members333.	Elections and Democratic Consolidation in West Africa: Comparative Study of Nigeria and Senegal, 1999-2012	Abiodun Surajudeen Fatai, Suzanne Francis, Abiodun Fatai	2017
736	As noted by the Economist (2007), President Obasanjo was accused of giving inducements to members of the National Assembly up to the tune of 50 million Naira (equivalent to US $ 6.5million).	Elections and Democratic Consolidation in West Africa: Comparative Study of Nigeria and Senegal, 1999-2012	Abiodun Surajudeen Fatai, Suzanne Francis, Abiodun Fatai	2017
737	As revealed in the memoir of Condoleezza Rice, a former US Secretary of State in 2011, 'in 2006 when President Olusegun Obasanjo of Nigeria sidled up President Bush and suggested that he (Obasanjo) might change the constitution so that he could serve a third term, President Bush told him not to do it' (Rice, 2011:638).	Elections and Democratic Consolidation in West Africa: Comparative Study of Nigeria and Senegal, 1999-2012	Abiodun Surajudeen Fatai, Suzanne Francis, Abiodun Fatai	2017
738	Obasanjo's behaviour consequently has been seen to be that of 'a deceptive democrat, whose penchant for power sporadically intoxicates like the Scottish rum'335.	Elections and Democratic Consolidation in West Africa: Comparative Study of Nigeria and Senegal, 1999-2012	Abiodun Surajudeen Fatai, Suzanne Francis, Abiodun Fatai	2017
739	As noted by a prominent newspaper columnist, Alamu Tatalo, 'if anything, the last ten years stand as an eloquent	Elections and Democratic Consolidation in West Africa: Comparative Study of Nigeria and Senegal, 1999-2012	Abiodun Surajudeen Fatai, Suzanne Francis, Abiodun Fatai	2017
740	This latter perception speaks more to Nigeria's 1999 constitution which was authored by the military.	Elections and Democratic Consolidation in West Africa: Comparative Study of Nigeria and Senegal, 1999-2012	Abiodun Surajudeen Fatai, Suzanne Francis, Abiodun Fatai	2017
741	The opposition parties, especially ACN view such attitude as a mutiny against the rule of law, and pressed for the reinstatement of Justice Salami by the National Assembly.	Elections and Democratic Consolidation in West Africa: Comparative Study of Nigeria and Senegal, 1999-2012	Abiodun Surajudeen Fatai, Suzanne Francis, Abiodun Fatai	2017
742	This phenomenon forced Justice Kayode Eso, one of the foremost SAN in Nigeria to lament that the judiciary has been ridden with opportunist 'billionaire election tribunal judges' who are undermining the integrity of the judiciary.	Elections and Democratic Consolidation in West Africa: Comparative Study of Nigeria and Senegal, 1999-2012	Abiodun Surajudeen Fatai, Suzanne Francis, Abiodun Fatai	2017
743	In this circumstance, many of the pseudo-democrats 'appear to embrace democratic principles while avoiding any risk of succumbing to popular preferences' (Roth, 2009:141).	Elections and Democratic Consolidation in West Africa: Comparative Study of Nigeria and Senegal, 1999-2012	Abiodun Surajudeen Fatai, Suzanne Francis, Abiodun Fatai	2017
744	Ideally, despite the divergence of political elites, their formation and composition is supposed to be based on the value system and ideological orientation which they share (Kifordu, 2011).	Elections and Democratic Consolidation in West Africa: Comparative Study of Nigeria and Senegal, 1999-2012	Abiodun Surajudeen Fatai, Suzanne Francis, Abiodun Fatai	2017
745	This explains why the likes of the late Olusola Saraki, Lamidi Adedibu and Andy Ubah among others have been influential members of Nigeria's political elite since 1999.	Elections and Democratic Consolidation in West Africa: Comparative Study of Nigeria and Senegal, 1999-2012	Abiodun Surajudeen Fatai, Suzanne Francis, Abiodun Fatai	2017
746	For instance the presidential candidates of CPC, General Muhammadu Buhari after losing the 2011 election was quoted as saying that he would not go to court and that the people should demand their mandate through demonstration.	Elections and Democratic Consolidation in West Africa: Comparative Study of Nigeria and Senegal, 1999-2012	Abiodun Surajudeen Fatai, Suzanne Francis, Abiodun Fatai	2017
747	To stress the fractured North-South relations, General Muhammadu Buhari, in the period leading to the 2011 elections also cautioned 'the political class, especially the ruling party that anybody who tries to undermine the interest of the people in the 2011 elections would be smashed by the kind of democratic revolution witnessed inNorth Africa' (Shiklam, 2011:23).	Elections and Democratic Consolidation in West Africa: Comparative Study of Nigeria and Senegal, 1999-2012	Abiodun Surajudeen Fatai, Suzanne Francis, Abiodun Fatai	2017
748	Although Buhari statement is a consequence of the crisis of the skewed electoral process which has seen him losing the presidential election three times since 1999, statements capable of inciting violence is unacceptable of any democrat.

749	Although the major recommendation of the charter have yet to be implemented by the current President, Macky Sall, who was a member of the dialogue, the abolition of the Senate (which was seen as the domain of patronage benefits reserved for the loyalists of the presidents) has been abolished.

750	To stress the fractured relations and contradictions among the Nigerian political elites, the former Governor of Kaduna state, Lawal Kaita, claimed during the crisis of zoning in Nigeria that:	Elections and Democratic Consolidation in West Africa: Comparative Study of Nigeria and Senegal, 1999-2012	Abiodun Surajudeen Fatai, Suzanne Francis, Abiodun Fatai	2017
751	As they [coalition of ethnic based political elites and their parties] pulled apart, they placed more value on capturing political power for themselves and grew increasingly fearful about what seemed to them to be the grave consequence of losing power to their rivals in the competitions for power.	Elections and Democratic Consolidation in West Africa: Comparative Study of Nigeria and Senegal, 1999-2012	Abiodun Surajudeen Fatai, Suzanne Francis, Abiodun Fatai	2017
752	As portrayed by a prominent member of APR, 'beyond the power tussle which ensured between Wade and his lieutenant [Idrissa Seck and Macky Sall], patronage control and instrumentalism was the defining conditions of elite formation in Senegal'.345 While there is breakdown of old coalition, new ones are formed.	Elections and Democratic Consolidation in West Africa: Comparative Study of Nigeria and Senegal, 1999-2012	Abiodun Surajudeen Fatai, Suzanne Francis, Abiodun Fatai	2017
753	For example, President Obasanjo in his anticorruption war exonerated state Governors who supported his third term agenda despite huge evidence of corruption against them, whereas the Economic Financial Crime Commission (EFCC) had persecuted his perceived opponents (Suberu, 2007).	Elections and Democratic Consolidation in West Africa: Comparative Study of Nigeria and Senegal, 1999-2012	Abiodun Surajudeen Fatai, Suzanne Francis, Abiodun Fatai	2017
754	Governors such as James of Ibori Delta state, Christopher of Alao-Akala of Oyo state, Olusegun Agagu of Ondo state, Alli Modu Sheriff of Bornu state, and Gabriel Suswan of Benue state, among others, had a free day syphoning and looting government covers (This Day, 2008).	Elections and Democratic Consolidation in West Africa: Comparative Study of Nigeria and Senegal, 1999-2012	Abiodun Surajudeen Fatai, Suzanne Francis, Abiodun Fatai	2017
755	According to Tamba (2006:47), 'many sitting deputies do not have an adequate level of education (80 members out of 150 in the current legislature are illiterate in French) to do parliamentary works'.	Elections and Democratic Consolidation in West Africa: Comparative Study of Nigeria and Senegal, 1999-2012	Abiodun Surajudeen Fatai, Suzanne Francis, Abiodun Fatai	2017
756	He was found wanting in the spending of 75 million naira for the purchase of Sallah [Muslim ceremony] ram for senate members (The Punch, May 12000).	Elections and Democratic Consolidation in West Africa: Comparative Study of Nigeria and Senegal, 1999-2012	Abiodun Surajudeen Fatai, Suzanne Francis, Abiodun Fatai	2017
757	The disapproval of the parliament against the constitutional changes of President Obasanjo and Abdoulaye Wade in 2007 and 2009 respectively, to elongate their tenure was suggestive of legislative autonomy in the face of executive abuse of the constitution.	Elections and Democratic Consolidation in West Africa: Comparative Study of Nigeria and Senegal, 1999-2012	Abiodun Surajudeen Fatai, Suzanne Francis, Abiodun Fatai	2017
758	This is because the costs of subverting democratic institutions are perceived to be worse than the costs of conformity.	Elections and Democratic Consolidation in West Africa: Comparative Study of Nigeria and Senegal, 1999-2012	Abiodun Surajudeen Fatai, Suzanne Francis, Abiodun Fatai	2017
759	Yet, respecting the rules is in their best interests and democracy since everyone gives up the culture of subverting democratic rules and procedures and democracy, is seen as the only game that is appropriate for their political system.	Elections and Democratic Consolidation in West Africa: Comparative Study of Nigeria and Senegal, 1999-2012	Abiodun Surajudeen Fatai, Suzanne Francis, Abiodun Fatai	2017
760	By respecting the rule of law and constitutionalism, political elites choose to refrain from anti-democratic behaviours which erode democratic legitimacy; rather, they value democratic incentives to prevent democracy from reversal.

764	In Senegal and Nigeria, therefore, the rule of law, constitutionalism, and liberties are not institutionalized, or are weakly entrenched, since the ruling elites who are supposed to be the custodian of the constitution are the ones undermining it through disregard for the equality of the law, constitutional breach and electoral violation.

776	Development aid flows from France to Senegal were chosen as the main variable through which to study the solidity of the Franco-Senegalese relationship because France is considered to be a strategic donor globally: a country which gives aid to countries that it believes to be important on the world stage, whether because they act as well positioned French supporters or because they are powers in their own right.

777	Finally, after the conclusion of World War II, France once again pursued developmental objectives reminiscent of the pre-World War I period, but this time for geopolitical reasons: France believed that a developed Senegal, integral part of its empire, would be an important source of stability and a counterweight to U.S. and Soviet power.

780	The French, initially threatened by the already highly influential networks of power created by Sufi confreries, or brotherhoods, like the Mouride and Tijaniyya orders, recognized that they would be unable to stretch their colonial influence across such a large territory without the help of local leaders who already had a great deal of credibility (Clark 152).

781	"This explains why 'forced labor,' the most notorious abuse of all, while considered an acceptable way to speed development efforts and to ""strengthen the natives' work ethic"" by French leaders, was codified to limit the amount of coercion that could be applied to the workforce (Conklin, ""A Mission"" 6)."

782	"Because the French viewed Africans as ""'others' who were nevertheless capable of improvement in France's own image,"" they felt morally responsible for undertaking ""inclusionary and reforming measures on [Africans'] behalf"" which made French republicanism, democracy, and colonization compatible (""Colonialism"" 423)."

783	"The French elite believed that because they had overcome limitations associated with geography, climate, and disease in addition to creating a democratic, republican government against all odds, France alone was equipped to ""uplift"" the African people of the ""dark continent"" - a term that referred both to the color of sub-Saharan African skin, but also the supposed ignorance in which they had lived before exposure to the ""enlightening"" force of French culture (Conklin, ""A Mission"" 6)."

786	French administrators were concerned about the growing power of educated African elites, but also regarding the tirrailleurs senegalais who had fought in France and were able to gain an insight into the workings of a more equal, republican society.

795	Controversy over imparting the full rights of French citizenship on the inhabitants of the colonies would contribute to the election of more nationalistic Senegalese leaders like Senghor - a writer and politician of peasant origins who supposedly spoke for the common man - in the 1950s because elites and non-elites alike did not believe their previous representatives were putting enough pressure on the metropole to make reforms (Atlan 140).

801	"French involvement in its former colonies through aid programs can be considered exploitative in character particularly because of France's tendency to encourage the ""mixing the private and the public, company objectives, personal relationships of French and African presidents, and the 'official' sphere of French foreign policy"" (Keese, ""First"" 594)."

817	"Xala, the seminal film written and directed in 1975 by Senegalese author and filmmaker Ousmane Sembene (1923-2007), known as the ""Father of African film,"" provides an excellent commentary on this phenomenon from the point of view of a leftist activist of humble fisherman's roots.51 Through the narrative of Xala, Sembene advances his perception of the position of Senegalese elites, and that of the majority of Senegalese society marginalized by the self-interested leadership corps."	Franco-Senegalese Relations through the Lens of Development Aid (1895-2012)	W&M ScholarWorks, Bridget Marie Carr	2020

819	The marabout accepts a large payment in return for his services (the size of which is emphasized by another colonial official giving El Hadji advice) and gives El Hadji a fetish (in Wolof, gri-gri), or spiritual token, which he claims will lift the curse.

820	For this reason, the French considered Senegal to be the lynchpin of the West Africa; Senegal's Francophile leaders could be used to secure the support and cooperation of the entire region.

821	Both former presidents Senghor (1960-1981) and Diouf (1981-1990) made the promotion of la Francophonie one of their highest priorities.	Franco-Senegalese Relations through the Lens of Development Aid (1895-2012)	W&M ScholarWorks, Bridget Marie Carr	2020
822	Unlike its French West African counterpart Cote d'Ivoire, Senegal was never considered an economic powerhouse - its importance to France lay mostly in the political, military, and cultural sphere (Crook 205-206; Keese 605).60 Therefore, in light of France's post-Cold War emphasis on fostering principally economically productive ties, France no longer held a significant interest in Senegal.	Franco-Senegalese Relations through the Lens of Development Aid (1895-2012)	W&M ScholarWorks, Bridget Marie Carr	2020
823	"Then-President Abdou Diouf of Senegal responded positively to the La Baule speech saying, ""la France a raison, de nous inciter a etre un pays de democratie, de justice et de liberte, et meme de conditionner son aide aux progres que nous accomplirons dans ce secteur."

824	Therefore, although Senegal is certainly a poverty-stricken nation, as a donor, France is much more interested in friendly, strategically important nations and could easily continue to choose to overlook Senegal's need in favor of a more prosperous nation with which it maintains better ties.

826	Senegalese society therefore considered the absence of principal French leaders at Senghor's funeral an ultimate demonstration of disloyalty.	Franco-Senegalese Relations through the Lens of Development Aid (1895-2012)	W&M ScholarWorks, Bridget Marie Carr	2020
827	"Sarkozy did not make a good first impression, nor did he disabuse his observers of the notion that he held disdain for foreigners.71 To begin his speech, Sarkozy spent a great deal of time emphasizing that he was not going to apologize for colonialism because ""nul ne peut demander aux fils de se repentir des fautes de leurs peres"" (Sarkozy)."

830	France began to shift its policies towards West Africa after the conclusion of the Cold War but to the extent that Senegalese leaders wanted to maintain relatively close ties, they were able to do so, especially through personal friendships fostered at Francophone summits.	Franco-Senegalese Relations through the Lens of Development Aid (1895-2012)	W&M ScholarWorks, Bridget Marie Carr	2020
831	Senegal, as the recipient of development assistance, is often seen as a passive actor, accepting its fate at the hands of France - and other global powers - but the significant weakening of the connection occurred only after Wade decided to take Senegalese diplomacy in a different direction.

834	The Sufi leaders that had once been the crucial element of maintenance of the Parti Socialist's power did not support Diouf in the 2000 election (Galvan 59).	Franco-Senegalese Relations through the Lens of Development Aid (1895-2012)	W&M ScholarWorks, Bridget Marie Carr	2020
835	Although Diouf was also a Muslim, as Senghor's successor he was still viewed by critics of the Parti Socialiste as being disloyal to the Muslim brotherhoods, highly connected to the unpopular, neocolonial French elite and a direct enemy to the sopi (or change) that voters desperately desired.

1137	The members of Santa Yalla thought that the women, as victims of armed conflict but still guardians of cultural and socio-economic values and traditions, had the responsibility to speak out, tell their story, and talk about peace and development (Kassumay, 2012).	WOMEN’S COMMUNITY RADIO IN AFRICA: THE CASE STUDY OF GINDIKU FM IN SENEGAL by FATOUMATA SOW	Fatoumata Sow, Leslie Steeves, Chairperson Carol Stabile, Gabriela Martínez, Yvonne A. Braun	2014
1138	In the early days of the radio, recalls Mane (2012), it was difficult to have people accept it as a way to communicate.

1140	One of the groups that most often speaks on the radio are La Plate Forme des Femmes pour la Paix en Casamance/The Women's Platform for Peace in Casamance, a federation of 170 associations from the regions of Kolda, Ziguinchor and Sedhiou, which used to be known as the Casamance Naturelle.	WOMEN’S COMMUNITY RADIO IN AFRICA: THE CASE STUDY OF GINDIKU FM IN SENEGAL by FATOUMATA SOW	Fatoumata Sow, Leslie Steeves, Chairperson Carol Stabile, Gabriela Martínez, Yvonne A. Braun	2014
1141	"According to the President of the ""Plate Forme,"" Kassumay is a friendly channel of communication that has established dialogue as a pathway to peace and mobilize for peace (Thiam N.

1144	The creation of ARLS was the idea of Mareme Kaire, a strong, 60-year-old determined activist who decided to take action to stop the devastating consequences of HIV/AIDS in rural communities.	WOMEN’S COMMUNITY RADIO IN AFRICA: THE CASE STUDY OF GINDIKU FM IN SENEGAL by FATOUMATA SOW	Fatoumata Sow, Leslie Steeves, Chairperson Carol Stabile, Gabriela Martínez, Yvonne A. Braun	2014
1145	After Kaire attended a seminar on AIDS that opened her eyes to the exclusion of rural populations from the fight against AIDS, she decided, together with other like-minded persons, to create the first rural association fighting HIV/AIDS.	WOMEN’S COMMUNITY RADIO IN AFRICA: THE CASE STUDY OF GINDIKU FM IN SENEGAL by FATOUMATA SOW	Fatoumata Sow, Leslie Steeves, Chairperson Carol Stabile, Gabriela Martínez, Yvonne A. Braun	2014
1146	Today, Mareme Kaire, who, like the majority of rural women, did not have the privilege of attending school and was married at the tender age of 15, runs the largest women's group in her region with a membership base of about 12,000 women.	WOMEN’S COMMUNITY RADIO IN AFRICA: THE CASE STUDY OF GINDIKU FM IN SENEGAL by FATOUMATA SOW	Fatoumata Sow, Leslie Steeves, Chairperson Carol Stabile, Gabriela Martínez, Yvonne A. Braun	2014
1147	By using various strategies, using mainly small meetings, group discussions, a forum theater, and an information kiosk installed in Touba Toul (the biggest weekly market of the Thies region), ARLS was able to join a large audience as well as widen its membership by getting women in the village to organize themselves in women's promotion groups.	WOMEN’S COMMUNITY RADIO IN AFRICA: THE CASE STUDY OF GINDIKU FM IN SENEGAL by FATOUMATA SOW	Fatoumata Sow, Leslie Steeves, Chairperson Carol Stabile, Gabriela Martínez, Yvonne A. Braun	2014
1148	So, activities to raise awareness reached only a small number of villages, and this forced the ARLS management to expand their coverage by opening a community radio that could reach a higher number of people.	WOMEN’S COMMUNITY RADIO IN AFRICA: THE CASE STUDY OF GINDIKU FM IN SENEGAL by FATOUMATA SOW	Fatoumata Sow, Leslie Steeves, Chairperson Carol Stabile, Gabriela Martínez, Yvonne A. Braun	2014
1149	In fact, Mareme Kaire, the founder of Radio Gindiku, was aware that the religious factor could be a challenge, so she tried to get the patronage of the Caliph of the Thienaba religious order even before beginning radio programs.	WOMEN’S COMMUNITY RADIO IN AFRICA: THE CASE STUDY OF GINDIKU FM IN SENEGAL by FATOUMATA SOW	Fatoumata Sow, Leslie Steeves, Chairperson Carol Stabile, Gabriela Martínez, Yvonne A. Braun	2014

WOMEN’S COMMUNITY RADIO IN AFRICA: THE CASE STUDY OF GINDIKU FM IN SENEGAL by FATOUMATA SOW	Fatoumata Sow, Leslie Steeves, Chairperson Carol Stabile, Gabriela Martínez, Yvonne A. Braun	2014
1151	To make sure the radio worked together with the highest possible number of local stakeholders, ARLS decided to open the management of the radio station to rural community presidents from the Thienaba sub-division.

WOMEN’S COMMUNITY RADIO IN AFRICA: THE CASE STUDY OF GINDIKU FM IN SENEGAL by FATOUMATA SOW	Fatoumata Sow, Leslie Steeves, Chairperson Carol Stabile, Gabriela Martínez, Yvonne A. Braun	2014
1153	These factors make Gindiku a radio for women who are working quietly to roll back the exclusion of rural women from the media, to give voice to rural women, and to broadcast gender-responsive programs.	WOMEN’S COMMUNITY RADIO IN AFRICA: THE CASE STUDY OF GINDIKU FM IN SENEGAL by FATOUMATA SOW	Fatoumata Sow, Leslie Steeves, Chairperson Carol Stabile, Gabriela Martínez, Yvonne A. Braun	2014
1154	The result expected is the enhancement of participation in the radio station of all community members and to contribute to the emergence of local leaders who are rooted in the economic, social and cultural realities of the communities.

WOMEN’S COMMUNITY RADIO IN AFRICA: THE CASE STUDY OF GINDIKU FM IN SENEGAL by FATOUMATA SOW	Fatoumata Sow, Leslie Steeves, Chairperson Carol Stabile, Gabriela Martínez, Yvonne A. Braun	2014

1161	"Talking about how to overcome the difficulty of gathering news, Fraser and Estrada (2001) describe the idea of the ""popular reporter"" as a response."	WOMEN’S COMMUNITY RADIO IN AFRICA: THE CASE STUDY OF GINDIKU FM IN SENEGAL by FATOUMATA SOW	Fatoumata Sow, Leslie Steeves, Chairperson Carol Stabile, Gabriela Martínez, Yvonne A. Braun	2014
1162	It is in this respect that elderly people, village chiefs and Imams have been accepting of talking about the history of the village, the family that founded the village, geographic and sociological changes the village has experienced, and the successful and unsuccessful events in the history of the village.	WOMEN’S COMMUNITY RADIO IN AFRICA: THE CASE STUDY OF GINDIKU FM IN SENEGAL by FATOUMATA SOW	Fatoumata Sow, Leslie Steeves, Chairperson Carol Stabile, Gabriela Martínez, Yvonne A. Braun	2014
1163	This aspect of the listening groups is extremely popular and has already enabled women to engage in trade and to open community shops that contribute largely to reduce the cost of basic foodstuffs, among other examples.	WOMEN’S COMMUNITY RADIO IN AFRICA: THE CASE STUDY OF GINDIKU FM IN SENEGAL by FATOUMATA SOW	Fatoumata Sow, Leslie Steeves, Chairperson Carol Stabile, Gabriela Martínez, Yvonne A. Braun	2014

1165	This program, according to the director, is so popular that even villages not covered by the women reporters want their history to be told.	WOMEN’S COMMUNITY RADIO IN AFRICA: THE CASE STUDY OF GINDIKU FM IN SENEGAL by FATOUMATA SOW	Fatoumata Sow, Leslie Steeves, Chairperson Carol Stabile, Gabriela Martínez, Yvonne A. Braun	2014
1166	But all the women reporters encountered for this study were convinced that any news on their community is priceless and worth sacrificing for.	WOMEN’S COMMUNITY RADIO IN AFRICA: THE CASE STUDY OF GINDIKU FM IN SENEGAL by FATOUMATA SOW	Fatoumata Sow, Leslie Steeves, Chairperson Carol Stabile, Gabriela Martínez, Yvonne A. Braun	2014

1169	The people working at Gindiku FM derive their motivation from informing listeners on what happens in their local areas with the voices and language of the community.

WOMEN’S COMMUNITY RADIO IN AFRICA: THE CASE STUDY OF GINDIKU FM IN SENEGAL by FATOUMATA SOW	Fatoumata Sow, Leslie Steeves, Chairperson Carol Stabile, Gabriela Martínez, Yvonne A. Braun	2014
1172	Finally, a small minority (four percent) believes there can no equality because the man is the head of the household.	WOMEN’S COMMUNITY RADIO IN AFRICA: THE CASE STUDY OF GINDIKU FM IN SENEGAL by FATOUMATA SOW	Fatoumata Sow, Leslie Steeves, Chairperson Carol Stabile, Gabriela Martínez, Yvonne A. Braun	2014
1173	With regard to equal rights, 41 percent of the respondents believed strongly in them, 30 percent agreed with the idea, while 20 percent did not agree (Table 8.2).

1187	On the issue of land access, women say that the programs broadcast on radio Gindiku have helped more and more women to advocate access to land, a land allocation system reserved for women, and even a housing area in Ngoudiane that would be reserved exclusively for women (Diop, 2012).	WOMEN’S COMMUNITY RADIO IN AFRICA: THE CASE STUDY OF GINDIKU FM IN SENEGAL by FATOUMATA SOW	Fatoumata Sow, Leslie Steeves, Chairperson Carol Stabile, Gabriela Martínez, Yvonne A. Braun	2014
1188	The programs are warmly welcomed by the community members for whom Gindiku FM is doing a wonderful job, by informing, educating, and raising consciousness on gender issues.

1189	Recent monitoring and studies mention some progress while pointing to the fact that the majority of rural women who are striving with poverty are almost ignored by the media (IWMF, 2011; IWMF, 2009).	WOMEN’S COMMUNITY RADIO IN AFRICA: THE CASE STUDY OF GINDIKU FM IN SENEGAL by FATOUMATA SOW	Fatoumata Sow, Leslie Steeves, Chairperson Carol Stabile, Gabriela Martínez, Yvonne A. Braun	2014
1190	Manoore FM was created in 2002 by Altercom, an organization of educated women whose objective is to use communication as a tool for women's liberation.	WOMEN’S COMMUNITY RADIO IN AFRICA: THE CASE STUDY OF GINDIKU FM IN SENEGAL by FATOUMATA SOW	Fatoumata Sow, Leslie Steeves, Chairperson Carol Stabile, Gabriela Martínez, Yvonne A. Braun	2014
1191	For the other three organizations, La Mutuelle d'Epargne et de Credit, Santa Yalla, and ARLS, the impulse to have a radio station came years after the organizations were created, and the radio was seen as a means to support and widen their community work.	WOMEN’S COMMUNITY RADIO IN AFRICA: THE CASE STUDY OF GINDIKU FM IN SENEGAL by FATOUMATA SOW	Fatoumata Sow, Leslie Steeves, Chairperson Carol Stabile, Gabriela Martínez, Yvonne A. Braun	2014
1192	"The Senegal Poverty Monitoring Report indicates that, ""in 2005-2006, the vast majority of the households, that is, more than 2 households out of three, consider they lacked sufficient financial resources to meet their food, housing, health and clothing needs, and to a lesser degree, to cover their ceremony expenditure"" (ANSD, 2007)."	WOMEN’S COMMUNITY RADIO IN AFRICA: THE CASE STUDY OF GINDIKU FM IN SENEGAL by FATOUMATA SOW	Fatoumata Sow, Leslie Steeves, Chairperson Carol Stabile, Gabriela Martínez, Yvonne A. Braun	2014
1193	The dominant young male reporters and volunteers, and the large committee in charge of the radio, did not have the same understanding of what is a community radio, what it is for, how it works, and so on.	WOMEN’S COMMUNITY RADIO IN AFRICA: THE CASE STUDY OF GINDIKU FM IN SENEGAL by FATOUMATA SOW	Fatoumata Sow, Leslie Steeves, Chairperson Carol Stabile, Gabriela Martínez, Yvonne A. Braun	2014
1194	Therefore, Gindiku FM needs to pay attention to these aspects and also to the fact that a significant number of women reporters and members of listening groups are convinced that women and men should not have the same rights and consequently will not advocate for gender equality, and changes in power relations.

1197	However, farmers continue to sell most of their groundnuts, as before, to the mills.	The Groundnut Market in Senegal: Examination of Price and Policy Changes	James K. Gray, Jeffrey R. Alwang, Michael K. Bertelsen, Anya M. McGuirk	2002
1198	Although females are not as involved in groundnut production, they do not seem to face discrimination in either the official or the open market.	The Groundnut Market in Senegal: Examination of Price and Policy Changes	James K. Gray, Jeffrey R. Alwang, Michael K. Bertelsen, Anya M. McGuirk	2002
1199	Only eight percent of the farmers had groundnut seed multiplication ratios less than one, and sixtyseven percent had ratios less than five.	The Groundnut Market in Senegal: Examination of Price and Policy Changes	James K. Gray, Jeffrey R. Alwang, Michael K. Bertelsen, Anya M. McGuirk	2002
1200	I'd also like to thank Thierno Ly, Ousmane Ndao, and Amadou Ndiaye, who administered the survey.	The Groundnut Market in Senegal: Examination of Price and Policy Changes	James K. Gray, Jeffrey R. Alwang, Michael K. Bertelsen, Anya M. McGuirk	2002
1201	The carre usually supports from two to five nuclear families, unmarried males (sourgas), and hired laborers (mbindanes) or sharecroppers (navetanes2).	The Groundnut Market in Senegal: Examination of Price and Policy Changes	James K. Gray, Jeffrey R. Alwang, Michael K. Bertelsen, Anya M. McGuirk	2002
1202	It is common for individuals to plant their personal fields in groundnuts to satisfy their need for cash.	The Groundnut Market in Senegal: Examination of Price and Policy Changes	James K. Gray, Jeffrey R. Alwang, Michael K. Bertelsen, Anya M. McGuirk	2002
1203	"In 1847, when it was recognized that Senegal's sandy soils and limited rainfall precluded the exploitation of other agricultural commodities, French Governor Protet proclaimed, ""peanuts will save the country""."	The Groundnut Market in Senegal: Examination of Price and Policy Changes	James K. Gray, Jeffrey R. Alwang, Michael K. Bertelsen, Anya M. McGuirk	2002
1204	Because of the economic return the marabouts foresaw for groundnut production, they urged their disciples to cultivate groundnuts on their lands.	The Groundnut Market in Senegal: Examination of Price and Policy Changes	James K. Gray, Jeffrey R. Alwang, Michael K. Bertelsen, Anya M. McGuirk	2002
1205	Thus, because of their interest in extending groundnut production, the colonial authorities granted many Tijaniyya and Mouride marabouts extensive tracts of land on which to grow groundnuts.	The Groundnut Market in Senegal: Examination of Price and Policy Changes	James K. Gray, Jeffrey R. Alwang, Michael K. Bertelsen, Anya M. McGuirk	2002
1206	They also supported the marabouts in their disputes with mainly Fulani herders over the conversion of traditional grazing lands into groundnut fields.	The Groundnut Market in Senegal: Examination of Price and Policy Changes	James K. Gray, Jeffrey R. Alwang, Michael K. Bertelsen, Anya M. McGuirk	2002
1207	The ologopolistic nature of the groundnut market led many people to believe that the individual farmer was not adequately protected.	The Groundnut Market in Senegal: Examination of Price and Policy Changes	James K. Gray, Jeffrey R. Alwang, Michael K. Bertelsen, Anya M. McGuirk	2002
1208	"It was envisioned that these groups would protect the farmers against a lack of foresight, help needy families during years of bad harvest, and distribute food during the soudure (end of the dry season/beginning of the rainy season often know as ""hungry time"")."	The Groundnut Market in Senegal: Examination of Price and Policy Changes	James K. Gray, Jeffrey R. Alwang, Michael K. Bertelsen, Anya M. McGuirk	2002
1209	The French recognized that the farmers' concern about food would inhibit expansion of groundnut cultivation.	The Groundnut Market in Senegal: Examination of Price and Policy Changes	James K. Gray, Jeffrey R. Alwang, Michael K. Bertelsen, Anya M. McGuirk	2002
1210	Their goal was to increase the distribution of high-yielding groundnut seeds through the SIPs to the farmers.	The Groundnut Market in Senegal: Examination of Price and Policy Changes	James K. Gray, Jeffrey R. Alwang, Michael K. Bertelsen, Anya M. McGuirk	2002
1211	Farmers were a bit suspicious of these arrangements, preferring to have one hundred percent up front.	The Groundnut Market in Senegal: Examination of Price and Policy Changes	James K. Gray, Jeffrey R. Alwang, Michael K. Bertelsen, Anya M. McGuirk	2002
1212	Besides their unwillingness to pay all the money up front, the SIPs never formed the personal bonds with the individual farmers.	The Groundnut Market in Senegal: Examination of Price and Policy Changes	James K. Gray, Jeffrey R. Alwang, Michael K. Bertelsen, Anya M. McGuirk	2002
1213	Furthermore, the private traders had already formed bonds with the local transporters (mostly people with donkey carts) to deny farmers the ability to ship their groundnuts to the SIPs.	The Groundnut Market in Senegal: Examination of Price and Policy Changes	James K. Gray, Jeffrey R. Alwang, Michael K. Bertelsen, Anya M. McGuirk	2002
1214	Since Senegal had come to rely on rice imports from Indochina, now unavailable, farmers became concerned more with food self-sufficiency that groundnut production and trade.

1215	The individual farmers felt that all these institutions, both private and state-run, were remote and thus received low priority for their support.	The Groundnut Market in Senegal: Examination of Price and Policy Changes	James K. Gray, Jeffrey R. Alwang, Michael K. Bertelsen, Anya M. McGuirk	2002
1216	They were an attempt by the government not only to free the farmers from the exploitative middlemen, but also to eliminate the system of rural patronage in the hands of local politicians and marabouts.	The Groundnut Market in Senegal: Examination of Price and Policy Changes	James K. Gray, Jeffrey R. Alwang, Michael K. Bertelsen, Anya M. McGuirk	2002
1217	Government middlemen soon gained a reputation for being corrupt and dependent on the local power structure.	The Groundnut Market in Senegal: Examination of Price and Policy Changes	James K. Gray, Jeffrey R. Alwang, Michael K. Bertelsen, Anya M. McGuirk	2002
1218	Because a good payer in one village felt rationally reluctant to cover the debts of bad payers in other villages, several collective debt defaults occurred.	The Groundnut Market in Senegal: Examination of Price and Policy Changes	James K. Gray, Jeffrey R. Alwang, Michael K. Bertelsen, Anya M. McGuirk	2002
1219	Their usual response was to ease the pain of the citizens and wait for the up swing in the cycle.	The Groundnut Market in Senegal: Examination of Price and Policy Changes	James K. Gray, Jeffrey R. Alwang, Michael K. Bertelsen, Anya M. McGuirk	2002
1220	This made it difficult for the OPS to give credit to farmers at a time when the farmers had few other avenues to receive credit.	The Groundnut Market in Senegal: Examination of Price and Policy Changes	James K. Gray, Jeffrey R. Alwang, Michael K. Bertelsen, Anya M. McGuirk	2002
1221	Second, the farmers were accustomed to purchasing fertilizer on credit and thus were unable to raise	The Groundnut Market in Senegal: Examination of Price and Policy Changes	James K. Gray, Jeffrey R. Alwang, Michael K. Bertelsen, Anya M. McGuirk	2002
1222	Rice is very popular in Senegalese urban markets and is increasing in popularity everywhere.	The Groundnut Market in Senegal: Examination of Price and Policy Changes	James K. Gray, Jeffrey R. Alwang, Michael K. Bertelsen, Anya M. McGuirk	2002
1223	Much of Senegal's import expenditures are on rice primarily to feed the urban population, although rice is becoming more popular in the diets of Senegalese throughout the country.	The Groundnut Market in Senegal: Examination of Price and Policy Changes	James K. Gray, Jeffrey R. Alwang, Michael K. Bertelsen, Anya M. McGuirk	2002
1224	Although farmers are now allowed to sell their groundnuts in the open market, after the groundnut harvest, agents of SONACOS still fan out around the Groundnut Basin offering farmers the official price.	The Groundnut Market in Senegal: Examination of Price and Policy Changes	James K. Gray, Jeffrey R. Alwang, Michael K. Bertelsen, Anya M. McGuirk	2002
1225	Since most of the villagers in the two regions are not fluent in French, the surveyors translated the questionnaire into the local language of the villagers, in most cases into Wolof, the predominant language in the regions.	The Groundnut Market in Senegal: Examination of Price and Policy Changes	James K. Gray, Jeffrey R. Alwang, Michael K. Bertelsen, Anya M. McGuirk	2002
1226	Thus in twenty-nine of the seventy-seven exploitations where more than one household was said to exist, no CMD was available for questioning, and thus no survey form was completed.	The Groundnut Market in Senegal: Examination of Price and Policy Changes	James K. Gray, Jeffrey R. Alwang, Michael K. Bertelsen, Anya M. McGuirk	2002
1227	Only twenty-nine households utilized navetanes; 150 employed a sourga; and only twenty-nine employed a mbindane.	The Groundnut Market in Senegal: Examination of Price and Policy Changes	James K. Gray, Jeffrey R. Alwang, Michael K. Bertelsen, Anya M. McGuirk	2002
1228	These adult males work primarily for the CE; only one household under the control of a CMD utilized either a sourga, navetane, or a mbindane.	The Groundnut Market in Senegal: Examination of Price and Policy Changes	James K. Gray, Jeffrey R. Alwang, Michael K. Bertelsen, Anya M. McGuirk	2002
1229	Every year around the beginning of June, farmers anxiously await the first rainfall.	The Groundnut Market in Senegal: Examination of Price and Policy Changes	James K. Gray, Jeffrey R. Alwang, Michael K. Bertelsen, Anya M. McGuirk	2002
1230	Farmers usually wait until the first significant rainfall before planting their groundnuts.	The Groundnut Market in Senegal: Examination of Price and Policy Changes	James K. Gray, Jeffrey R. Alwang, Michael K. Bertelsen, Anya M. McGuirk	2002
1231	To address the lack of field-specific rainfall information, farmers were asked their perceptions of the 1997 rainy season in terms of quantity and duration.	The Groundnut Market in Senegal: Examination of Price and Policy Changes	James K. Gray, Jeffrey R. Alwang, Michael K. Bertelsen, Anya M. McGuirk	2002
1232	Farmers said whether they considered the rains good, average, or bad.	The Groundnut Market in Senegal: Examination of Price and Policy Changes	James K. Gray, Jeffrey R. Alwang, Michael K. Bertelsen, Anya M. McGuirk	2002
1233	This allowed the villagers' perceptions of the rains to be compared with the actual rainfall in nearby meteorological posts.	The Groundnut Market in Senegal: Examination of Price and Policy Changes	James K. Gray, Jeffrey R. Alwang, Michael K. Bertelsen, Anya M. McGuirk	2002
1234	Forty-one percent of the farmers felt that the quantity of rain that fell on their farms was bad; thirty-nine perce said it was average; and only twenty percent thought the quantity was good.	The Groundnut Market in Senegal: Examination of Price and Policy Changes	James K. Gray, Jeffrey R. Alwang, Michael K. Bertelsen, Anya M. McGuirk	2002
1235	The farmers judged the distribution of the rains over time to be worse than the quantity of rain.	The Groundnut Market in Senegal: Examination of Price and Policy Changes	James K. Gray, Jeffrey R. Alwang, Michael K. Bertelsen, Anya M. McGuirk	2002
1236	Only five percent thought the distribution of the rains over time was good; seventyone percent thought it was bad; and twenty-four percent thought it was average.	The Groundnut Market in Senegal: Examination of Price and Policy Changes	James K. Gray, Jeffrey R. Alwang, Michael K. Bertelsen, Anya M. McGuirk	2002
1237	In twenty-two of the thirty villages, no one thought the duration of the rains was good.	The Groundnut Market in Senegal: Examination of Price and Policy Changes	James K. Gray, Jeffrey R. Alwang, Michael K. Bertelsen, Anya M. McGuirk	2002
1238	In six of the villages, everyone agreed that the duration of the rains was bad.	The Groundnut Market in Senegal: Examination of Price and Policy Changes	James K. Gray, Jeffrey R. Alwang, Michael K. Bertelsen, Anya M. McGuirk	2002
1239	Table 3.9 lists the villages ranked by the sum of the farmers' two perceptions of the past season's rainfall.	The Groundnut Market in Senegal: Examination of Price and Policy Changes	James K. Gray, Jeffrey R. Alwang, Michael K. Bertelsen, Anya M. McGuirk	2002
1240	Most of these farmers (210 out of 213) produce arachide huilerie.	The Groundnut Market in Senegal: Examination of Price and Policy Changes	James K. Gray, Jeffrey R. Alwang, Michael K. Bertelsen, Anya M. McGuirk	2002
1241	Less than twenty percent of the farmers (49) grew arachide de bouche, and fewer than four percent grew arachide semence.8 (See Table 3.12.)	The Groundnut Market in Senegal: Examination of Price and Policy Changes	James K. Gray, Jeffrey R. Alwang, Michael K. Bertelsen, Anya M. McGuirk	2002
1242	Nearly all households (220) report that they produced millet, the main subsistence crop in Senegal.	The Groundnut Market in Senegal: Examination of Price and Policy Changes	James K. Gray, Jeffrey R. Alwang, Michael K. Bertelsen, Anya M. McGuirk	2002
1243	Almost a quarter of the farmers (54) in the survey sold millet, although the total amount sold was only eight percent of total production.	The Groundnut Market in Senegal: Examination of Price and Policy Changes	James K. Gray, Jeffrey R. Alwang, Michael K. Bertelsen, Anya M. McGuirk	2002
1244	A second farmer, who produced only sixty kilograms of cotton, used his crop to reimburse a previous loan.	The Groundnut Market in Senegal: Examination of Price and Policy Changes	James K. Gray, Jeffrey R. Alwang, Michael K. Bertelsen, Anya M. McGuirk	2002
1245	Of the thirtyeight farmers in the survey who said they planted watermelon seeds, thirty-three sold their output on the open market for an average of over 78,000 fCFA.	The Groundnut Market in Senegal: Examination of Price and Policy Changes	James K. Gray, Jeffrey R. Alwang, Michael K. Bertelsen, Anya M. McGuirk	2002
1246	Therefore, the farmers found it impossible to determine the exact number of watermelons in their fields or their size and quality--characteristics that significantly affected the price paid.	The Groundnut Market in Senegal: Examination of Price and Policy Changes	James K. Gray, Jeffrey R. Alwang, Michael K. Bertelsen, Anya M. McGuirk	2002
1247	Fifty-five farmers in the survey reported selling some or all of their groundnut grass, yielding, on average, over 48,000 fCFA.	The Groundnut Market in Senegal: Examination of Price and Policy Changes	James K. Gray, Jeffrey R. Alwang, Michael K. Bertelsen, Anya M. McGuirk	2002
1248	Many of the minor crops, especially bissap (leaves from a bush used to prepare a refreshing red drink) are easily marketable in nearby towns.	The Groundnut Market in Senegal: Examination of Price and Policy Changes	James K. Gray, Jeffrey R. Alwang, Michael K. Bertelsen, Anya M. McGuirk	2002
1249	Twelve farmers in the survey produced and sold bissap, realizing, on average, over 30,000 fCFA.	The Groundnut Market in Senegal: Examination of Price and Policy Changes	James K. Gray, Jeffrey R. Alwang, Michael K. Bertelsen, Anya M. McGuirk	2002
1250	Almost seventy-three percent of the farmers surveyed produced less than three metric tons of groundnuts each.	The Groundnut Market in Senegal: Examination of Price and Policy Changes	James K. Gray, Jeffrey R. Alwang, Michael K. Bertelsen, Anya M. McGuirk	2002
1251	Only nine farmers (less than five percent of the survey) produced more than ten tons, a figure frequently used to describe a large-scale farmer.	The Groundnut Market in Senegal: Examination of Price and Policy Changes	James K. Gray, Jeffrey R. Alwang, Michael K. Bertelsen, Anya M. McGuirk	2002
1252	The farmer in the survey who produced the most groundnuts grew more than 32 tons, over nine tons more than the next largest producer.	The Groundnut Market in Senegal: Examination of Price and Policy Changes	James K. Gray, Jeffrey R. Alwang, Michael K. Bertelsen, Anya M. McGuirk	2002
1253	Six percent of the farmers surveyed grew less than 200 kilograms, and the least amount of groundnuts harvested by any farmer was 33 kilograms.	The Groundnut Market in Senegal: Examination of Price and Policy Changes	James K. Gray, Jeffrey R. Alwang, Michael K. Bertelsen, Anya M. McGuirk	2002
1254	Slightly over sixty-nine percent of the farmers grew less than two tons of millet; eighty-nine percent grew less than three tons.	The Groundnut Market in Senegal: Examination of Price and Policy Changes	James K. Gray, Jeffrey R. Alwang, Michael K. Bertelsen, Anya M. McGuirk	2002
1255	It would be ideal if high output to labor ratios were correlated to the farmers' perceptions of the rainfall quantity and distribution over time.	The Groundnut Market in Senegal: Examination of Price and Policy Changes	James K. Gray, Jeffrey R. Alwang, Michael K. Bertelsen, Anya M. McGuirk	2002
1256	In Table 3.13, one can see a reasonably strong correlation between the average output to labor ratios in a village and the farmers' perceptions about the quantity of the rain.10 The correlation with the duration of the rainfall was not as strong.	The Groundnut Market in Senegal: Examination of Price and Policy Changes	James K. Gray, Jeffrey R. Alwang, Michael K. Bertelsen, Anya M. McGuirk	2002
1257	As might be expected, the farmers usually felt that when rainfall quantity was good (or bad), its duration was also good (or bad).	The Groundnut Market in Senegal: Examination of Price and Policy Changes	James K. Gray, Jeffrey R. Alwang, Michael K. Bertelsen, Anya M. McGuirk	2002
1258	A much smaller percent of the arachide de bouche and the arachide semence were eaten since these types of groundnut usually bring a higher price in the market.	The Groundnut Market in Senegal: Examination of Price and Policy Changes	James K. Gray, Jeffrey R. Alwang, Michael K. Bertelsen, Anya M. McGuirk	2002
1259	In the survey, only 57 farmers (27%) used N2 seed.	The Groundnut Market in Senegal: Examination of Price and Policy Changes	James K. Gray, Jeffrey R. Alwang, Michael K. Bertelsen, Anya M. McGuirk	2002
1260	The farmers in the survey identified a shortage of fertilizer as the second most important reason for any fall in groundnut production.	The Groundnut Market in Senegal: Examination of Price and Policy Changes	James K. Gray, Jeffrey R. Alwang, Michael K. Bertelsen, Anya M. McGuirk	2002
1261	Just over one fifth of the farmers listed it as the most important reason for the fall in production, and almost seventy-five percent felt it was one of the top three reasons.	The Groundnut Market in Senegal: Examination of Price and Policy Changes	James K. Gray, Jeffrey R. Alwang, Michael K. Bertelsen, Anya M. McGuirk	2002
1262	Fifty-four percent of the farmers indicated that a shortage of material was an important reason for the decline in their groundnut production, although only eighteen percent thought it was the main reason.	The Groundnut Market in Senegal: Examination of Price and Policy Changes	James K. Gray, Jeffrey R. Alwang, Michael K. Bertelsen, Anya M. McGuirk	2002
1263	Eight percent of the farmers surveyed said that the poverty of the soil was the most important reason for the decline in their groundnut production, and another thirty-six percent rated it as second or third in importance.	The Groundnut Market in Senegal: Examination of Price and Policy Changes	James K. Gray, Jeffrey R. Alwang, Michael K. Bertelsen, Anya M. McGuirk	2002
1264	A shortage of labor was noted as an important factor in a decline in groundnut production by only twelve percent of the farmers.	The Groundnut Market in Senegal: Examination of Price and Policy Changes	James K. Gray, Jeffrey R. Alwang, Michael K. Bertelsen, Anya M. McGuirk	2002
1265	Only eleven percent of the farmers thought the phyto-sanitary problems contributed to any fall in their production.	The Groundnut Market in Senegal: Examination of Price and Policy Changes	James K. Gray, Jeffrey R. Alwang, Michael K. Bertelsen, Anya M. McGuirk	2002
1266	A preference for other crops or activities was thought to be important by only six percent of the farmers, and less than a half percent thought it was of paramount importance.	The Groundnut Market in Senegal: Examination of Price and Policy Changes	James K. Gray, Jeffrey R. Alwang, Michael K. Bertelsen, Anya M. McGuirk	2002
1267	According to their own perceptions, the CMDs did not feel penalized by an inability to access equipment or labor in a timely manner.	The Groundnut Market in Senegal: Examination of Price and Policy Changes	James K. Gray, Jeffrey R. Alwang, Michael K. Bertelsen, Anya M. McGuirk	2002
1268	As mentioned above, over seventy-eight percent of the farmers in the survey felt they did not have access to enough groundnut seed.	The Groundnut Market in Senegal: Examination of Price and Policy Changes	James K. Gray, Jeffrey R. Alwang, Michael K. Bertelsen, Anya M. McGuirk	2002
1269	Arachide huilerie was by far the most popular groundnut crop used by ninety-seven percent of the farmers who planted groundnuts.	The Groundnut Market in Senegal: Examination of Price and Policy Changes	James K. Gray, Jeffrey R. Alwang, Michael K. Bertelsen, Anya M. McGuirk	2002
1270	Only eight farmers (or four percent) planted arachide semence, and since no farmers planted N1 seed, it seems than no one in the survey was involved in a commercial seed multiplication program.	The Groundnut Market in Senegal: Examination of Price and Policy Changes	James K. Gray, Jeffrey R. Alwang, Michael K. Bertelsen, Anya M. McGuirk	2002
1271	"However, only fifty-seven (25%) farmers used the improved N2 seed, a seed they typically had to purchase and which is bred to be better than ""ordinary"" seed."	The Groundnut Market in Senegal: Examination of Price and Policy Changes	James K. Gray, Jeffrey R. Alwang, Michael K. Bertelsen, Anya M. McGuirk	2002
1272	"Most farmers (206 or 89%) relied totally on their own ""ordinary"" seed or added to their own seed by purchasing ""ordinary"" or N2 seed in the market."	The Groundnut Market in Senegal: Examination of Price and Policy Changes	James K. Gray, Jeffrey R. Alwang, Michael K. Bertelsen, Anya M. McGuirk	2002
1273	More than ninety percent (45) of the farmers who planted arachide de bouche and all of the farmers who planted arachide semence purchased seed.	The Groundnut Market in Senegal: Examination of Price and Policy Changes	James K. Gray, Jeffrey R. Alwang, Michael K. Bertelsen, Anya M. McGuirk	2002
1274	By contrast, just over sixty percent (131) of the farmers who planted arachide huilerie purchased seed, and many of these supplemented purchase seed with their own seed stock.	The Groundnut Market in Senegal: Examination of Price and Policy Changes	James K. Gray, Jeffrey R. Alwang, Michael K. Bertelsen, Anya M. McGuirk	2002
1275	Of the forty-nine farmers who planted arachide de bouche, thirty-seven planted and thirty-six purchased N2 seed.	The Groundnut Market in Senegal: Examination of Price and Policy Changes	James K. Gray, Jeffrey R. Alwang, Michael K. Bertelsen, Anya M. McGuirk	2002
1276	Since arachide de bouche and arachide semence usually command a higher price than arachide huilerie, one would expect farmers to be more concerned about the quality of their seed for these groundnut categories.	The Groundnut Market in Senegal: Examination of Price and Policy Changes	James K. Gray, Jeffrey R. Alwang, Michael K. Bertelsen, Anya M. McGuirk	2002
1277	Very few (18) of the farmers who planted arachide huilerie used the more expensive N2 seed.	The Groundnut Market in Senegal: Examination of Price and Policy Changes	James K. Gray, Jeffrey R. Alwang, Michael K. Bertelsen, Anya M. McGuirk	2002
1278	The inability to acquire chemical fertilizer (manque d'engrais) was second to a shortage of seed in the farmers' perceptions as a reason for any decline in their groundnut production.	The Groundnut Market in Senegal: Examination of Price and Policy Changes	James K. Gray, Jeffrey R. Alwang, Michael K. Bertelsen, Anya M. McGuirk	2002
1279	In the survey, only forty-six percent (or 99) of the farmers who planted groundnuts used any chemical fertilizers.	The Groundnut Market in Senegal: Examination of Price and Policy Changes	James K. Gray, Jeffrey R. Alwang, Michael K. Bertelsen, Anya M. McGuirk	2002
1280	The percentages, however, were much higher for those farmers who planted the usually more profitable arachide de bouche (94%) or arachide semence (88%).	The Groundnut Market in Senegal: Examination of Price and Policy Changes	James K. Gray, Jeffrey R. Alwang, Michael K. Bertelsen, Anya M. McGuirk	2002
1281	Only sixty-three (or 29%) of the 214 farmers who planted arachide huilerie applied chemical fertilizers.	The Groundnut Market in Senegal: Examination of Price and Policy Changes	James K. Gray, Jeffrey R. Alwang, Michael K. Bertelsen, Anya M. McGuirk	2002
1282	Of the 213 farmers who grew groundnuts, only one reported that he applied manure systematically to his fields.13	The Groundnut Market in Senegal: Examination of Price and Policy Changes	James K. Gray, Jeffrey R. Alwang, Michael K. Bertelsen, Anya M. McGuirk	2002
1283	Of the 220 farmers who grew millet, less than thirty percent (65 farmers) applied chemical fertilizer to their fields.	The Groundnut Market in Senegal: Examination of Price and Policy Changes	James K. Gray, Jeffrey R. Alwang, Michael K. Bertelsen, Anya M. McGuirk	2002
1284	Sixty-five percent (or 143 farmers) applied on average 14.6 charrettes (animal-drawn carts) of manure to their fields in addition to whatever manure was deposited on the fields during the parcage.	The Groundnut Market in Senegal: Examination of Price and Policy Changes	James K. Gray, Jeffrey R. Alwang, Michael K. Bertelsen, Anya M. McGuirk	2002
1285	In theory, farmers should be more willing to pay more for the fertilizer to be used on more valuable groundnut crops arachide de bouche and arachide semence.	The Groundnut Market in Senegal: Examination of Price and Policy Changes	James K. Gray, Jeffrey R. Alwang, Michael K. Bertelsen, Anya M. McGuirk	2002
1286	Thus it is common for farmers to treat their seed before planting.	The Groundnut Market in Senegal: Examination of Price and Policy Changes	James K. Gray, Jeffrey R. Alwang, Michael K. Bertelsen, Anya M. McGuirk	2002
1287	In the survey, eighty-five percent (181) of all the farmers treated their seed in advance with fungicide.	The Groundnut Market in Senegal: Examination of Price and Policy Changes	James K. Gray, Jeffrey R. Alwang, Michael K. Bertelsen, Anya M. McGuirk	2002
1288	A slightly higher percentage (88%) of the farmers who planted arachide de bouche treated their seed, while for arachide huilerie the figure was only seventy-four percent.	The Groundnut Market in Senegal: Examination of Price and Policy Changes	James K. Gray, Jeffrey R. Alwang, Michael K. Bertelsen, Anya M. McGuirk	2002
1289	Five of the eight farmers who planted arachide semence treated their seed.	The Groundnut Market in Senegal: Examination of Price and Policy Changes	James K. Gray, Jeffrey R. Alwang, Michael K. Bertelsen, Anya M. McGuirk	2002
1290	On average, farmers used about 1.5 grams of fungicide for every kilogram of seed planted.	The Groundnut Market in Senegal: Examination of Price and Policy Changes	James K. Gray, Jeffrey R. Alwang, Michael K. Bertelsen, Anya M. McGuirk	2002
1291	Thus the average farmer would have to spend less than 6,000 fCFA to treat all his seeds.	The Groundnut Market in Senegal: Examination of Price and Policy Changes	James K. Gray, Jeffrey R. Alwang, Michael K. Bertelsen, Anya M. McGuirk	2002
1292	Despite the relatively low cost, fifteen percent of the farmers did not treat their seed.	The Groundnut Market in Senegal: Examination of Price and Policy Changes	James K. Gray, Jeffrey R. Alwang, Michael K. Bertelsen, Anya M. McGuirk	2002
1293	Farmers paid more on average for fungicide used on arachide de bouche than on arachide huilerie.	The Groundnut Market in Senegal: Examination of Price and Policy Changes	James K. Gray, Jeffrey R. Alwang, Michael K. Bertelsen, Anya M. McGuirk	2002
1294	However, there was no difference in the price paid for the fungicide used on arachide huilerie and for that used on arachide semence (There are only three farmers who purchased fungicide for use on arachide semence.)	The Groundnut Market in Senegal: Examination of Price and Policy Changes	James K. Gray, Jeffrey R. Alwang, Michael K. Bertelsen, Anya M. McGuirk	2002
1295	Farmers in the current survey reported that on average they sold their groundnuts within one kilometer of their village.	The Groundnut Market in Senegal: Examination of Price and Policy Changes	James K. Gray, Jeffrey R. Alwang, Michael K. Bertelsen, Anya M. McGuirk	2002
1296	Less than a quarter of the farmers surveyed travel further than two kilometers, and less than six percent have to travel further than five kilometers.	The Groundnut Market in Senegal: Examination of Price and Policy Changes	James K. Gray, Jeffrey R. Alwang, Michael K. Bertelsen, Anya M. McGuirk	2002
1297	As mentioned above, farmers want to seed as soon as possible after the first significant rain.	The Groundnut Market in Senegal: Examination of Price and Policy Changes	James K. Gray, Jeffrey R. Alwang, Michael K. Bertelsen, Anya M. McGuirk	2002
1298	Of the 210 farmers who grew arachide huilerie, sixteen reported harvesting fewer groundnuts than they planted.	The Groundnut Market in Senegal: Examination of Price and Policy Changes	James K. Gray, Jeffrey R. Alwang, Michael K. Bertelsen, Anya M. McGuirk	2002
1299	The fact that twenty-one farmers reported multiplication ratios greater than ten may lead one to suspect that there are some inaccuracies in the data since seed multiplication ratios of ten or greater compare favorably to multiplication ratios in areas with soils and climates better suited for groundnuts than the regions of Kaolack and Fatick.	The Groundnut Market in Senegal: Examination of Price and Policy Changes	James K. Gray, Jeffrey R. Alwang, Michael K. Bertelsen, Anya M. McGuirk	2002
1300	While only two farmers reported harvesting less arachide de bouche than they planted, almost forty percent achieved a multiplication ratio less than four.	The Groundnut Market in Senegal: Examination of Price and Policy Changes	James K. Gray, Jeffrey R. Alwang, Michael K. Bertelsen, Anya M. McGuirk	2002
1301	Only nine farmers achieved a multiplication ratio greater than eight.	The Groundnut Market in Senegal: Examination of Price and Policy Changes	James K. Gray, Jeffrey R. Alwang, Michael K. Bertelsen, Anya M. McGuirk	2002
1302	As with the farmers who grew arachide huilerie, a higher than expected number of farmers (12%) achieved a multiplication ratio greater than ten.	The Groundnut Market in Senegal: Examination of Price and Policy Changes	James K. Gray, Jeffrey R. Alwang, Michael K. Bertelsen, Anya M. McGuirk	2002
1303	Only eight farmers harvested arachide semence, and all of them used the improved N2 seed.	The Groundnut Market in Senegal: Examination of Price and Policy Changes	James K. Gray, Jeffrey R. Alwang, Michael K. Bertelsen, Anya M. McGuirk	2002
1304	Approximately one fourth (55) of all the farmers in the current survey took advantage of the opportunity to sell their groundnuts on the open market.	The Groundnut Market in Senegal: Examination of Price and Policy Changes	James K. Gray, Jeffrey R. Alwang, Michael K. Bertelsen, Anya M. McGuirk	2002
1305	In the current survey, over seventy-seven percent (or 343 metric tons) of the 440 metric tons of groundnuts marketed by the farmers surveyed through official channels was arachide huilerie.	The Groundnut Market in Senegal: Examination of Price and Policy Changes	James K. Gray, Jeffrey R. Alwang, Michael K. Bertelsen, Anya M. McGuirk	2002
1306	The 59 households who sold arachide de bouche sold on average 1.4 metric tons; the 145 households who sold arachide huilerie sold on average 2.3 metric tons; and the eight households who sold arachide semence sold on average 1.5 metric tons.	The Groundnut Market in Senegal: Examination of Price and Policy Changes	James K. Gray, Jeffrey R. Alwang, Michael K. Bertelsen, Anya M. McGuirk	2002
1307	The mean price received by the sixty farmers who sold arachide de bouche was 151.7 fCFA per kilogram while the mean prices for arachide huilerie and arachide semence were 149.7 and 157.5 respectively.	The Groundnut Market in Senegal: Examination of Price and Policy Changes	James K. Gray, Jeffrey R. Alwang, Michael K. Bertelsen, Anya M. McGuirk	2002
1308	The forty-five tons sold on the open market by the fifty-five farmers represented only thirty-five percent of the 128 tons that these households marketed and only twenty-seven percent of the amount of groundnuts grown.	The Groundnut Market in Senegal: Examination of Price and Policy Changes	James K. Gray, Jeffrey R. Alwang, Michael K. Bertelsen, Anya M. McGuirk	2002
1309	Twenty-five of the farmers who sold on both the official and the open market sold less than half their product on the open market.	The Groundnut Market in Senegal: Examination of Price and Policy Changes	James K. Gray, Jeffrey R. Alwang, Michael K. Bertelsen, Anya M. McGuirk	2002
1310	These farmers accounted for twenty-six of the forty-five tons of groundnuts sold on the open market.	The Groundnut Market in Senegal: Examination of Price and Policy Changes	James K. Gray, Jeffrey R. Alwang, Michael K. Bertelsen, Anya M. McGuirk	2002
1311	On average, farmers who sold on the open market sold 1.8 tons of arachide de bouche and 2.7 tons of arachide huilerie through official channels, but only one ton of groundnuts on the open market.	The Groundnut Market in Senegal: Examination of Price and Policy Changes	James K. Gray, Jeffrey R. Alwang, Michael K. Bertelsen, Anya M. McGuirk	2002
1312	Twel of the nineteen farmers who sold their cotton sold it on the official market, realizing an average price of 183 fCFA/kg.	The Groundnut Market in Senegal: Examination of Price and Policy Changes	James K. Gray, Jeffrey R. Alwang, Michael K. Bertelsen, Anya M. McGuirk	2002
1313	The fifty-four farmers who sold mille the market place received, on average, 69,393 fCFA.	The Groundnut Market in Senegal: Examination of Price and Policy Changes	James K. Gray, Jeffrey R. Alwang, Michael K. Bertelsen, Anya M. McGuirk	2002
1314	Only farmers sold maize, receiving on average 41,630 fCFA.	The Groundnut Market in Senegal: Examination of Price and Policy Changes	James K. Gray, Jeffrey R. Alwang, Michael K. Bertelsen, Anya M. McGuirk	2002

1517	Since the price and availability of inputs is a big concern for poorer farmers, they have a vested interest in the services offered by the COOPEC/RESOPP system, but are also vulnerable to accumulating debt when failing to repay the loan at the end of the season.

1519	Weather index insurance, on the contrary, is expected to incentivise high-risk high-return crop cultivation, since it ensures compensation when a shock occurs (International Fund for Agricultural Development and World Food Programme, 2010).

1522	Unfortunately, the 4 rain gauges were not enough to cover the entire study population as 5 rain gauges were originally expected to be in place at the beginning of the rainy season, but the installation of the last gauge was postponed at the last minute.

1523	Other farmers for whom the credit was refused had the option of purchasing insurance directly from the insurer (with higher transaction costs and no possibility of pre-financing the premium through credit) if they were interested.

1524	As explained in the input section, only 4 rain gauges were installed amongst the 5 expected, which led to a shift from WII to traditional insurance for people who wanted to take the WII and whose localities were not covered by rain gauges Thus, amongst the 253 farmers who decided to take insurance, 158 farmers actually purchased WII, while 96 purchased traditional insurance.

1525	Unclear, however, is whether the bundled product is perceived as a valuable product by farmers, how it corresponds to their specific needs, whether liquidity issues and a lack of collateral are actually the main constraints to WII take-up and financial inclusion, and whether making bundling a mandatory or a voluntary option drives take-up more.

1530	As interviewers were unable to meet some of the initial participants and others refused further participation in the study, a total of 346 farmers were interviewed during the survey.

1531	Moreover, the perception of interviewed farmers suggests a situation that has put them under increasing stress: 54% of them say that rainfall has declined during the last three years and more than 35% believe that it has become more erratic (Figure 19).

1532	Thus, amongst people recording no losses from a shock, 26.51% decided not to take the insurance product.

1533	In the survey, only 8.53% of the interviewed farmers thought that index insurance could not help them manage rainfall deficit risks.

1534	Some farmers, for instance, assumed that a policy would allow them to receive an indemnification in case of flood, while others linked the product to bad harvests in general, without specifying a sufficiently large and specifically timed rainfall-deficit as the condition13.

1537	KII respondents and local agents regarded WII as a mechanism to enhance overall stability of COOPEC/RESOPP activities, a way to secure loans and an incentive for increasing investments in agriculture.	Bundling weather index insurance and credit in Senegal: contributors and constraints to take-up	Mame Mor Anta, Djibril Moussa, Lam (ADG, Arona Diop (RESOPP, Assane Faye, Omar Cisse, Assane Sylla, Mame Fatou Diagne, Cheikh Tidiane Ndiaye	2020
1538	Whether these co-benefits will incentivise insurance take-up, however, is expected to depend on farmers' financial assets and preferences.	Bundling weather index insurance and credit in Senegal: contributors and constraints to take-up	Mame Mor Anta, Djibril Moussa, Lam (ADG, Arona Diop (RESOPP, Assane Faye, Omar Cisse, Assane Sylla, Mame Fatou Diagne, Cheikh Tidiane Ndiaye	2020
1539	Concerning the need for credit, we find that 66.47% of the surveyed producers declare that they do not have the capacity to finance an agricultural season on the basis of their own capital.	Bundling weather index insurance and credit in Senegal: contributors and constraints to take-up	Mame Mor Anta, Djibril Moussa, Lam (ADG, Arona Diop (RESOPP, Assane Faye, Omar Cisse, Assane Sylla, Mame Fatou Diagne, Cheikh Tidiane Ndiaye	2020
1540	In addition, more than 70% of those who have subscribed to index insurance are producers who have difficulties financing productive activities with their own funds (Figure 13) and 93% of those who have taken the insurance say that bundling is a sufficient motivation to subscribe.	Bundling Weather Index Insurance and Credit in Senegal	Lena Weingärtner	2017
1541	Indeed, as the FGDs highlighted, due to low access to credit and agricultural inputs (seeds and fertiliser more specifically), people did not take the risk to decrease their chance to get funded, even if they did not fully grasp the concept of the WII or the bundled product.	Bundling weather index insurance and credit in Senegal: contributors and constraints to take-up	Mame Mor Anta, Djibril Moussa, Lam (ADG, Arona Diop (RESOPP, Assane Faye, Omar Cisse, Assane Sylla, Mame Fatou Diagne, Cheikh Tidiane Ndiaye	2020
1542	From FGDs it became evident that some farmers in this group did not believe in the independence between WII and credit, which may have been related to spill-over effects, for instance when farmers heard about the implications from family or friends who may have been in one of the treatment groups.	Bundling weather index insurance and credit in Senegal: contributors and constraints to take-up	Mame Mor Anta, Djibril Moussa, Lam (ADG, Arona Diop (RESOPP, Assane Faye, Omar Cisse, Assane Sylla, Mame Fatou Diagne, Cheikh Tidiane Ndiaye	2020
1543	Most farmers in the control group then took their decision as if the insurance was bundled to the credit because they feared to reduce their chance to be granted a loan.

1544	Overall, 72.5% of producers who were network members and had applied for credit through COOPEC before the start of the 2017 rainy season decided to take the insurance, while 27.5% were reluctant to do so (Figure 11).

1546	The smaller producers amongst the cooperative membership seem to be the most receptive to index insurance and the use it could provide them in a context where rainfall variability is a major concern and where agriculture is crucial for their survival.

1548	On the supply side, WII was mainly expected to increase institutional stability in a context where loan default is high.

1549	Though integrating credit and insurance products is already implemented at scale with indemnity insurance in Northern Senegal, some stakeholders in the farmers' network, as well as farmers themselves, were adamant about their willingness to have the free choice of purchasing WII without mandatory integration with credit.	Bundling weather index insurance and credit in Senegal: contributors and constraints to take-up	Mame Mor Anta, Djibril Moussa, Lam (ADG, Arona Diop (RESOPP, Assane Faye, Omar Cisse, Assane Sylla, Mame Fatou Diagne, Cheikh Tidiane Ndiaye	2020
1550	For FOs and their related microfinance institutions, voluntary insurance can also be more preferred, because they want to give their members the freedom to choose.

1551	For independent microfinance institutions in which farmers are not members, complete integration is easier to implement, but its effect would be expected to depend on the level of competition they are facing in the credit market (mandatory insurance could be preferred in a context of low competition and voluntary insurance in a context of high competition).

1552	Currently, the Senegalese national insurance company CNAAS has signed agreements with a range of microfinance institutions FOs for providing integrated, mandatory bundling of indemnity insurance and WII with credit while other institutions and FOs still prefer voluntary bundling.

1554	Regarding the weight of the intervention in terms of time it cost the farmers, FGD participants highlighted the fact that in the approaching of the first rainfalls, farmers are very busy with the preparation of the rainy season.

1555	Finally, the probability to insure increases as the perceived basis risk decreases, jumping from 11.4% for farmers who perceive high basis risk to 16.3% for farmers who have low perception (rather similar) and 18.9% for farmers who consider that there is no basis risk (similar).

2016	Pursuant to the KJWA roadmap, topic 2.e improved livestock management systems, including agropastoral production systems and others, Senegal is pleased to make this submission as follows:	REPUBLIQUE DU SENEGAL Un Peuple - Un But - Une Foi SUBMISSION BY SENEGAL TO SBSTA/SBI 52 WORKSHOP ON THE TOPIC 2.e OF THE KORONIVIA JOINT WORK ON AGRICULTURE ROADMAP: IMPROVED LIVESTOCK MANAGEMENT SYSTEMS, INCLUDING AGROPASTORAL PRODUCTION SYSTEMS AND OTHERS Preamble Livestock production systems are a major economic activity providing various goods and services in sub-Saharan Africa. The sector contributes to economic growth, poor people’s incomes, job creation, food security and poverty reduction, especially in rural and peri- urban areas. There are mainly four livestock systems with different vulnerability to climate change, including the urban and peri-urban system, the small rural livestock system, the agro-pastoral system and the transhumant pastoral system. In addition to its direct role on incomes and food security, livestock contributes to the performance of agriculture through animal force, land fertilization, as well as formation and maintenance of legume parklands that livestock facilitates dissemination and renewal, enhancing fertility and carbon storage. Pastoral and agro-pastoral production systems were badly affected by the cyclical droughts characterizing the Sahel region in 1970s, with high water stress and scarcity, leading to competition for water points and grazing lands. On the other hand, the economic, ecological and social changes occurred during recent decades lead also to cropland and settlements expansion with reduction in pastoral areas, and conflicts between farmers and pastoralists. Given the cross-border dimension of pastoralism and its evolution in an ever-changing ecological environment, a structural and systemic response is needed than never before to meet social, economic and ecological challenges. Therefore, regional and international stakeholders committed, during the N’Djamena symposium, to leveraging pastoral livestock to enhance security and development in the saharo-sahelian area. Furthermore, the Nouakchott declaration emphasizes actions to improve the productivity, sustainability and resilience of pastoral livelihoods in the Sahel. The full commitment of states leads to the implementation of the Regional Support Project for Pastoralism in the Sahel (PRAPS). In Senegal, livestock farming is practiced by 60% of households, the majority (73,8%) of which live in rural areas (ANSD, 2014). It is predominated by extensive systems exploiting water resources and natural pastures in particular, and therefore remains vulnerable to climate change. The variability on rainfalls leads to regular water stress and scarcity in grassland, which gradually lose their grazed flora diversity and fodder potential, increasing the pressure on available resources, and decreasing the productivity of domestic breeds. Furthermore, sahelian pastoral systems experienced high mortality during extreme events. Senegal is committed to improve the resilience of livestock sector to various shocks and its contribution to food security and poverty reduction. Substantial progress was achieved in improving livestock productivity and diversification, promoting forage crops, climate insurance and sustainable natural resource management through pastoral units approach, pastoral hydraulic facilities, research and epidemiological surveillance. Much attention was paid to promote pastoralism in national land use master plan and policy, as well as ecogeographical zoning		2020

2076	The region's population is mainly Muslim (75%) but with significant Christian (17%, mostly Catholic) and animist (8%) minorities; the Diola are c.60% Muslim.	Senegal: Mouvement des Forces Démocratiques de la Casamance (MFDC)	Martin Evans	2004

2079	Secret MFDC meetings continued and on 6 December at Diabir, near Ziguinchor, three gendarmes were killed when they entered a sacred grove to arrest participants at one such gathering; some 50 people were subsequently arrested.	Senegal: Mouvement des Forces Démocratiques de la Casamance (MFDC)	Martin Evans	2004
2080	Ziguinchor town is estimated to have received some 14,000 IDPs while thousands more have swollen other Casamance towns and relatively secure villages.	Senegal: Mouvement des Forces Démocratiques de la Casamance (MFDC)	Martin Evans	2004
2081	Many of the displaced have returned in recent years, partly under USAIDfunded projects - an estimated 10,000-15,000 returnees are expected in 2004 alone - but the need for de-mining, land clearance and reconstruction to support them presents a huge challenge.	Senegal: Mouvement des Forces Démocratiques de la Casamance (MFDC)	Martin Evans	2004
2082	However, Abbe Diamacoune denounced the Cacheu accords for failing to address the MFDC's central demand for Casamance independence.	Senegal: Mouvement des Forces Démocratiques de la Casamance (MFDC)	Martin Evans	2004
2083	Badji and his followers therefore regrouped as the Front Nord and retired from active combat against Senegalese forces, in informal exchange for which they were allowed to retain de facto control of much of the northwest of Bignona department, with few or no Senegalese forces present in the area covered until recently.	Senegal: Mouvement des Forces Démocratiques de la Casamance (MFDC)	Martin Evans	2004
2084	Ostensibly 'pacified' and engaged in economic development of its zone, the Front Nord is regarded by some as a positive political force for peace.	Senegal: Mouvement des Forces Démocratiques de la Casamance (MFDC)	Martin Evans	2004
2085	Following the Cacheu accords, Abbe Diamacoune aligned himself with maquis commander Leopold Sagna, who took over from Badji as Chief of Staff but now controlled only the more militant Front Sud; this operated south of the Casamance River with its rear bases mainly along both sides of the Casamance's porous forested border with Guinea-Bissau.	Senegal: Mouvement des Forces Démocratiques de la Casamance (MFDC)	Martin Evans	2004
2086	Sagna's moderate stance and direct contact with President Diouf alienated him from hardliners in both the military and political wings, who instead grouped themselves around one of his younger lieutenants, Salif Sadio.	Senegal: Mouvement des Forces Démocratiques de la Casamance (MFDC)	Martin Evans	2004
2087	In June 1998 Guinea-Bissau's then Chief of Staff, Brigadier General Ansumane Mane, launched a military coup after being scapegoated by then President Joao Bernardo ('Nino') Vieira for arms supply to MFDC maquisards.	Senegal: Mouvement des Forces Démocratiques de la Casamance (MFDC)	Martin Evans	2004
2088	This action also included the forced removal from parts of the border zone of refugees believed to be linked with hardline maquisards.	Senegal: Mouvement des Forces Démocratiques de la Casamance (MFDC)	Martin Evans	2004
2089	They are largely found at the western end of the border zone with their main base at Kassolol, near the coastal town of Varela.	Senegal: Mouvement des Forces Démocratiques de la Casamance (MFDC)	Martin Evans	2004
2090	They continue to be harassed sporadically by Bissau-Guinean forces and are forbidden to enter Sao Domingos (to which Mane used to grant them laissez-passer) while Badiate's men apparently have freedom of movement.	Senegal: Mouvement des Forces Démocratiques de la Casamance (MFDC)	Martin Evans	2004
2091	Such concerns were justified in early October when some 600 Bissau-Guinean soldiers mutinied, complaining of pay arrears related to their recently completed tour of duty in Liberia, poor living conditions in barracks and corruption among senior officers.	Senegal: Mouvement des Forces Démocratiques de la Casamance (MFDC)	Martin Evans	2004
2092	According to one former maquisard, in the early days of the rebellion senior activists (including Sagna) held 'awareness meetings' where they explained the reasons for claiming independence, especially those rooted in the MFDC version of colonial history: 'They made us understand that we weren't the same [as the rest of Senegal] because we had our autonomy'.	Senegal: Mouvement des Forces Démocratiques de la Casamance (MFDC)	Martin Evans	2004
2093	However, there are accounts of child maquisards, albeit not as frontline combatants: a reliable eyewitness in Bissau during the 1998-9 civil war said that among the Front Sud contingent bolstering Mane's forces were a number of young teenagers, 13-15 years old, who carried out support operations such as transporting munitions.	Senegal: Mouvement des Forces Démocratiques de la Casamance (MFDC)	Martin Evans	2004
2094	The nordiste-dominated Senegalese government initially denounced the rebellion as 'une affaire diola' and in the past, government forces in the Casamance have harassed, arrested and attacked individuals and communities on the basis of their Diola ethnicity alone.	Senegal: Mouvement des Forces Démocratiques de la Casamance (MFDC)	Martin Evans	2004
2095	The MFDC, meanwhile, generally pursues a nationalist discourse, claiming to represent all ethnic groups present in the Casamance and denying any Diola bias, although some maquisards have targeted non-Diola for attack.	Senegal: Mouvement des Forces Démocratiques de la Casamance (MFDC)	Martin Evans	2004
2096	The fluidity of nationality status across this border was well illustrated in 2001 when many Casamance Diola - estimated by some to be in the tens of thousands - were registered as Gambian voters in the election that kept the country's Diola president, Yahya Jammeh, in power.	Senegal: Mouvement des Forces Démocratiques de la Casamance (MFDC)	Martin Evans	2004
2097	Some observers characterize the Sagna/Sadio split in ethno-religious terms, claiming that it is a manifestation of differences between the Kasa Diola subgroup (Sagna), from Oussouye department, and the Fogny (Sadio), from Bignona department, which have a religious dimension of predominantly Christian or animist versus predominantly Muslim respectively.	Senegal: Mouvement des Forces Démocratiques de la Casamance (MFDC)	Martin Evans	2004
2098	Members of the latter (now Badiate) faction interviewed thus felt betrayed, claiming that they had not benefited from their support for Mane.	Senegal: Mouvement des Forces Démocratiques de la Casamance (MFDC)	Martin Evans	2004
2099	Maquis elements from north of the Casamance River are said to exchange cannabis for arms in The Gambia, although there is no firm evidence for this.	Senegal: Mouvement des Forces Démocratiques de la Casamance (MFDC)	Martin Evans	2004
2100	His relationships with them present a mixed picture, with his home village and much-used presidential retreat of Kanilaye less than 2km from the border with the Casamance - specifically the Djibidione area, a stronghold of Front Sud hardliners.	Senegal: Mouvement des Forces Démocratiques de la Casamance (MFDC)	Martin Evans	2004
2101	Jammeh was also a close friend of Mane, a Gambian Mandingo by birth who in turn supplied Front Sud elements.	Senegal: Mouvement des Forces Démocratiques de la Casamance (MFDC)	Martin Evans	2004
2102	Members of the Badiate faction insisted that they no longer receive any arms through Guinea-Bissau or The Gambia.	Senegal: Mouvement des Forces Démocratiques de la Casamance (MFDC)	Martin Evans	2004
2103	Arms are known to cross Senegal's other land borders (with Mauritania and Mali) and there are trafficking centres elsewhere in the country, including Dakar (where arms enter through the port) and the holy city of Touba (where state authority is limited and where local weapons production is also active).	Senegal: Mouvement des Forces Démocratiques de la Casamance (MFDC)	Martin Evans	2004
2104	One maquisard spoke of Badji's exhausting training regime, from 5 am to 11 pm every day over several weeks, with instruction given in weaponry, mechanics and tactics.	Senegal: Mouvement des Forces Démocratiques de la Casamance (MFDC)	Martin Evans	2004
2105	More invidious attacks have occurred against civilians.16 On the night of 9 September 1997 some 20 maquisards burst into a dance at Djibanar, south of the Casamance River in Sedhiou department, reproaching the youths there for partying while the maquis was fighting for independence.	Senegal: Mouvement des Forces Démocratiques de la Casamance (MFDC)	Martin Evans	2004
2106	Newer recruits, it seems, receive little training: as one former maquisard complained, 'Now they only get shown a rifle and how to use it for a couple of hours.'	Senegal: Mouvement des Forces Démocratiques de la Casamance (MFDC)	Martin Evans	2004
2107	Another source, present in Bissau at the time of the civil war there, asked one of Mane's commanders how much help the maquisards were: tellingly, he replied that they were 'useless - they're here to learn'.	Senegal: Mouvement des Forces Démocratiques de la Casamance (MFDC)	Martin Evans	2004
2108	Conversely, a young Bissau-Guinean combatant who also fought on Mane's side said in interview that the maquis contingent at least brought useful experience of fighting the Senegalese army.	Senegal: Mouvement des Forces Démocratiques de la Casamance (MFDC)	Martin Evans	2004
2109	In the early days of the rebellion, the MFDC benefited from much more widespread and organized (though still covert) popular support than it has today.	Senegal: Mouvement des Forces Démocratiques de la Casamance (MFDC)	Martin Evans	2004
2110	Cannabis (yamba) is another long-established crop: it is grown elsewhere in Senegal but the Casamance climate is more favourable and it is cultivated particularly in the Karone Isles in the west of Bignona department.	Senegal: Mouvement des Forces Démocratiques de la Casamance (MFDC)	Martin Evans	2004
2111	Two former maquisards interviewed said that on their bases during calm periods, they used to make bags, purses and shoes from doeskin, for sale via intermediaries at Ziguinchor's tourist market.	Senegal: Mouvement des Forces Démocratiques de la Casamance (MFDC)	Martin Evans	2004
2112	Food given to refugees in both Guinea-Bissau and The Gambia has supported maquisards there to a limited extent, while that given to rural populations in situ in the Casamance has sometimes made an attractive target for armed robbery by maquis or criminal elements.	Senegal: Mouvement des Forces Démocratiques de la Casamance (MFDC)	Martin Evans	2004
2113	Members of one refugee community visited near Sao Domingos were supplied with oranges and doe meat, from abandoned border areas of the Casamance, by their sons and brothers in the Front Sud.	Senegal: Mouvement des Forces Démocratiques de la Casamance (MFDC)	Martin Evans	2004
2114	One former maquisard explained how, because he had received Red Cross training at school, he and another refugee (a healthcare professional) provided medical care to injured maquisards or the many cases of malaria in Guinea-Bissau, to where he had been displaced with his family.	Senegal: Mouvement des Forces Démocratiques de la Casamance (MFDC)	Martin Evans	2004
2115	Sadio formerly sent lists of medicinal requirements to agencies in Ziguinchor at the start of the wet season; these included antibiotics, antimalarials, vermifuges and rehydration salts, indicative of poor living conditions in the bush.	Senegal: Mouvement des Forces Démocratiques de la Casamance (MFDC)	Martin Evans	2004
2116	As one local NGO officer cynically put it, 'Being a maquisard has become a job - you just wait in the bush for your slice of the cake.'	Senegal: Mouvement des Forces Démocratiques de la Casamance (MFDC)	Martin Evans	2004
2117	At the village of Mongone in early September 2004, various maquis factions (though none of the key leaders) agreed to try to formulate a common position for direct negotiations with the Senegalese government to take place by the end of the year.	Senegal: Mouvement des Forces Démocratiques de la Casamance (MFDC)	Martin Evans	2004
2118	Casamancais are thankful for this in itself and because it also allows large-scale return of the displaced, and much-needed reconstruction of houses, public buildings and transport and agricultural infrastructure.	Senegal: Mouvement des Forces Démocratiques de la Casamance (MFDC)	Martin Evans	2004
2119	Some members of both main Front Sud factions apparently fear that they are being sold out after years in the bush fighting for independence, which the political wing has effectively renounced.	Senegal: Mouvement des Forces Démocratiques de la Casamance (MFDC)	Martin Evans	2004
2120	On 1 April 2004 three soldiers on de-mining operations near Guidel, near the Guinea-Bissau border and in the operational zone of the Sadio faction, were killed although the political wing denied MFDC responsibility.	Senegal: Mouvement des Forces Démocratiques de la Casamance (MFDC)	Martin Evans	2004
2121	Subsequently, the claim of one of the above interviewees that his group would launch attacks during the 2004 wet season seems to have been realized, in a small way: on the night of 23-24 June, two rockets were fired at the military post at Djirack, a Casamance village just across the border from the Badiate stronghold.	Senegal: Mouvement des Forces Démocratiques de la Casamance (MFDC)	Martin Evans	2004
2122	Maquisards interviewed from both the Djibidione and Badiate groups claimed to recognize Abbe Diamacoune's authority, and other factions have done so publicly in recent years.	Senegal: Mouvement des Forces Démocratiques de la Casamance (MFDC)	Martin Evans	2004
2123	In Guinea-Bissau, where ongoing harassment of Sadio's men by government forces and more moderate maquis elements reached another peak in bombardments on 16 October 2004, those on the receiving end of the attacks called on Abbe Diamacoune to intervene on their behalf.	Senegal: Mouvement des Forces Démocratiques de la Casamance (MFDC)	Martin Evans	2004
2124	In the current context, this recognition of Abbe Diamacoune by many maquisards may stem partly from a belief that he is still their best chance for a good economic settlement.	Senegal: Mouvement des Forces Démocratiques de la Casamance (MFDC)	Martin Evans	2004
2125	Bertrand is also clearly mistrusted on the ground: a number of maquisards and local NGO workers interviewed regarded his agenda as predatory.	Senegal: Mouvement des Forces Démocratiques de la Casamance (MFDC)	Martin Evans	2004
2126	The Badiate maquisards interviewed denounced him as 'a seeker of money - that's what we don't like, corruption, when we have gone to defend the colours of our nation'.	Senegal: Mouvement des Forces Démocratiques de la Casamance (MFDC)	Martin Evans	2004
2127	He saw this as a sign of the government's lack of sincerity in negotiations, given the political wing's (self-appointed) roles as the main channel through which peace can be achieved and as the popular representative of the interests of Casamancais - discourses that can be seen as either naive or disingenuous, but that certainly bear little relationship to reality.	Senegal: Mouvement des Forces Démocratiques de la Casamance (MFDC)	Martin Evans	2004
2128	Many observers and the Badiate maquisards interviewed saw this farce as another attempt by Bertrand to bolster his position and attract donor funding.	Senegal: Mouvement des Forces Démocratiques de la Casamance (MFDC)	Martin Evans	2004
2129	One 'relay agent' of the Badiate faction interviewed in Guinea-Bissau claimed to be unaware of Abbe Diamacoune's most recent convocation.	Senegal: Mouvement des Forces Démocratiques de la Casamance (MFDC)	Martin Evans	2004
2130	While any material vested interests in conflict appear low, different maquis factions vary in their willingness to concede political demands for economic benefits, namely development funding for themselves and the region.	Senegal: Mouvement des Forces Démocratiques de la Casamance (MFDC)	Martin Evans	2004
2131	In apparent contradiction of their respective labels as 'hardliners' and 'moderates', members of the Djibidione group interviewed seemed prepared to accept such a tradeoff while Badiate maquisards were not, as illustrated above.	Senegal: Mouvement des Forces Démocratiques de la Casamance (MFDC)	Martin Evans	2004
2132	Fear of Senegalese forces was also evident among some Casamance refugees interviewed in Guinea-Bissau and those forced to return after the expulsions of 2001, despite much-changed circumstances and indeed official support given to returnees.	Senegal: Mouvement des Forces Démocratiques de la Casamance (MFDC)	Martin Evans	2004
2133	This too has historical roots, in a perceived quid pro quo whereby Casamance support in Guinea-Bissau's war of liberation (the presence of PAIGC rear bases even prompted the Portuguese to bomb the Middle Casamance town of Sedhiou) should be reciprocated by Bissau-Guinean support for the Casamance's own independence struggle.	Senegal: Mouvement des Forces Démocratiques de la Casamance (MFDC)	Martin Evans	2004
2134	Another was arrested and, despite wanting to return to the maquis after his release, his marabout advised him against it - a reason that his former comrades respected.	Senegal: Mouvement des Forces Démocratiques de la Casamance (MFDC)	Martin Evans	2004
2135	In their new businesses, most preferred to go to parts of the region other than where they were known, sometimes for their past actions.	Senegal: Mouvement des Forces Démocratiques de la Casamance (MFDC)	Martin Evans	2004
2136	In one village visited, near the Djibidione area, house reconstruction for a returning senior maquisard was at first blocked by the village chief because of the former's past crimes in the village including, according to one source, exactions and rape.	Senegal: Mouvement des Forces Démocratiques de la Casamance (MFDC)	Martin Evans	2004
2137	The youth team leader eventually helped convince village elders to give the maquisard a second chance, but even then the returnee was himself reticent because of possible reprisals, returning only after some time and then not leaving his new house without a protective entourage.	Senegal: Mouvement des Forces Démocratiques de la Casamance (MFDC)	Martin Evans	2004
2138	They generally felt that Wade was acting in good faith but accused some of his agents of being inadequately supervised, making false promises, not acting in an even-handed way and possibly siphoning off funds.	Senegal: Mouvement des Forces Démocratiques de la Casamance (MFDC)	Martin Evans	2004
2139	But while the interviewees were clear about their material wants, they were less precise about how peace would be delivered from the maquis side, with disarmament seen as a lower priority than the return of refugees from The Gambia and development of the area.	Senegal: Mouvement des Forces Démocratiques de la Casamance (MFDC)	Martin Evans	2004
2140	Human rights observers expressed concern that this risks promoting impunity, while some Casamancais felt that the government should not have granted the amnesty without first obtaining a definitive peace settlement from a unified MFDC (if that were possible).	Senegal: Mouvement des Forces Démocratiques de la Casamance (MFDC)	Martin Evans	2004
2141	Some MFDC elements, meanwhile, felt predictably insulted when the amnesty was mooted and when it was enacted, following their habitual discourse that they had done nothing wrong but simply acted to defend their 'nation'.	Senegal: Mouvement des Forces Démocratiques de la Casamance (MFDC)	Martin Evans	2004
2142	Some former maquisards even run rural development projects: one heads his own NGO while another is an organizer at village level.	Senegal: Mouvement des Forces Démocratiques de la Casamance (MFDC)	Martin Evans	2004
2143	For instance in a press interview in April 2004 Madame Simone Gbagbo, wife of Cote d'Ivoire's president, acerbically remarked that Wade should settle the Casamance conflict before trying to intervene in her country's problems.

2158	The United States views Senegal as an anchor of regional stability and a potential partner in combating transnational security threats, such as terrorism, narcotics trafficking, and maritime piracy.	Senegal: Background and U.S. Relations	Alexis Arieff	2011
2159	Since 2008, popular demonstrations have repeatedly erupted over a range of issues, including power cuts, unemployment, food prices, and the president's attempts to prolong his time in office.	Senegal: Background and U.S. Relations	Alexis Arieff	2011
2160	However, most observers believe Wade's candidacy would require a constitutional amendment.8 In any case, an amendment to the constitution could potentially be easy to secure, given the ruling party's overwhelming majority in the national legislature.	Senegal: Background and U.S. Relations	Alexis Arieff	2011
2161	Turnout was reported at 73% of registered voters.10 However, the main opposition coalition of 12 parties contested the results and called for the redrawing of district boundaries and the replacement of the head of the national elections commission, whom opposition leaders perceived as biased toward the ruling party.	Senegal: Background and U.S. Relations	Alexis Arieff	2011
2162	While Wade remains popular among some segments of the population, signs of an electoral backlash, inspired by political as well as economic grievances, have recently emerged.	Senegal: Background and U.S. Relations	Alexis Arieff	2011
2163	This reinforced concern among many Senegalese that Wade was planning a dynastic succession by promoting his son's political aspirations.13 While discontent reportedly remains high, the peaceful acceptance of opposition gains in 2009 convinced some observers that the electoral system retained a potential for fairness.	Senegal: Background and U.S. Relations	Alexis Arieff	2011
2164	Perceptions of cronyism--particularly the sense that Wade is promoting his son, Karim, as a presidential successor--have provoked particular ire among the Senegalese public.	Senegal: Background and U.S. Relations	Alexis Arieff	2011
2165	"The further creation, in 2006, of a Senate in which 65 of 100 members are selected by the president, followed by the ruling party's electoral sweep in 2007, led local civil society groups to warn of ""the de-facto return of a singleparty system in all state institutions."	Senegal: Background and U.S. Relations	Alexis Arieff	2011
2166	Some advocates allege that the president has taken steps to undermine the independence of regulatory and oversight bodies, including the electoral commission, the media regulator, and the judiciary.19 The Senegalese press has also portrayed Wade as taking harsh steps to marginalize potential political opponents, such as former Prime Minister Idrissa Seck, who was dismissed from his position in 2004, then arrested and charged with embezzlement and threatening national security.	Senegal: Background and U.S. Relations	Alexis Arieff	2011
2167	Senegal has been particularly praised for its HIV/AIDS programs, which were initiated in the mid-1980s--long before most--and have contributed to a low rate of infection (less than 1% of the adult population) compared to many African countries.21 Senegal's anti-malaria program, launched in 2005, has also received praise.22 However, observers contend that official corruption is rising, and some analysts have critiqued the concentration of wealth in the capital and among a relatively small elite.

2170	It relies on imports for 70% of its food supply - a rate higher than any other country in Sub-Saharan Africa.55 The effects of global climate change are expected to further worsen food insecurity in Senegal, as in much of the region.56 Discontent over socioeconomic conditions has contributed to a high rate of emigration, particularly among young men and often in highly unsafe conditions.57	Senegal: Background and U.S. Relations	Alexis Arieff	2011

2172	The cocaine trade is thought to benefit from well-established regional smuggling networks and routes that are also leveraged for duty-free cigarettes, counterfeit prescription drugs, small arms, and persons.70 Senegal's relatively good transportation and telecommunications infrastructure may also serve as a draw for traffickers.

2362	Our results suggest that whether WII is a mandatory or a voluntary addition to credit is not relevant for overall take-up in a context where farmers depend on external financing for agricultural activities, as farmers expect the bundling to support credit applications and facilitate re-payment even after a bad rainy season.

2374	As explained in the input section, only 4 rain gauges were installed amongst the 5 expected, which led to a shift from WII to traditional insurance for people who wanted to take the WII and whose localities were not covered by rain gauges Thus, amongst the 253 farmers who decided to take insurance, 158 farmers actually purchased WII, while 96 purchased traditional insurance.

2375	Unclear, however, is whether the bundled product is perceived as a valuable product by farmers, how it corresponds to their specific needs, whether liquidity issues and a lack of collateral are actually the main constraints to WII take-up and financial inclusion, and whether making bundling a mandatory or a voluntary option drives take-up more.

2384	Some farmers, for instance, assumed that a policy would allow them to receive an indemnification in case of flood, while others linked the product to bad harvests in general, without specifying a sufficiently large and specifically timed rainfall-deficit as the condition14.

2385	While only 15% of survey respondents stated that receiving insurance pay-outs after a bad rainy season and the option to pre-finance premiums through credit were not sufficient as an incentive to purchase WII, many FGDs revolved around the need to also take into account and manage other risks.

2386	This appeared to be a concern not only for farmers, but also for the insurer (CNAAS) and intermediary WII provider (COOPEC/RESOPP).

2387	KII respondents and local agents regarded WII as a mechanism to enhance overall stability of COOPEC/RESOPP activities, a way to secure loans and an incentive for increasing investments in agriculture.

2388	Whether these co-benefits will incentivise insurance take-up, however, is expected to depend on farmers' financial assets and preferences.

2390	In addition, almost than 70% of those who have subscribed to index insurance are producers who have difficulties financing productive activities with their own funds (Figure 13) and 93% of those who have taken the insurance say that bundling is a sufficient motivation to subscribe.

2391	Indeed, as the FGDs highlighted, due to low access to credit and agricultural inputs (seeds and fertiliser more specifically), people did not take the risk to decrease their chance to get funded, even if they did not fully grasp the concept of the WII or the bundled product.	Bundling weather index insurance and credit in Senegal: contributors and constraints to take-up	Mame Mor Anta, Djibril Moussa, Lam (ADG, Arona Diop (RESOPP, Assane Faye, Omar Cisse, Assane Sylla, Mame Fatou Diagne, Cheikh Tidiane Ndiaye	2020
2392	From FGDs it became evident that some farmers in this group did not believe in the independence between WII and credit, which may have been related to spill-over effects, for instance when farmers heard about the implications from family or friends who may have been in one of the treatment groups.	Bundling weather index insurance and credit in Senegal: contributors and constraints to take-up	Mame Mor Anta, Djibril Moussa, Lam (ADG, Arona Diop (RESOPP, Assane Faye, Omar Cisse, Assane Sylla, Mame Fatou Diagne, Cheikh Tidiane Ndiaye	2020
2393	Most farmers in the control group then took their decision as if the insurance was bundled to the credit because they feared to reduce their chance to be granted a loan.

2402	For independent microfinance institutions in which farmers are not members, complete integration is easier to implement, but its effect would be expected to depend on the level of competition they are facing in the credit market (mandatory insurance could be preferred in a context of low competition and voluntary insurance in a context of high competition).

2675	When it comes to financial inclusion in the form of access to credit, the widely used dichotomous approach of distinguishing between constrained and unconstrained farmers often fails to accurately portray the heterogeneity of the credit profile of farmers.	Heterogeneous Credit Constraints and Smallholder Farming in Senegal	Abdoulaye Seck, Cheikh Anta Diop	2017
2676	Some farmers may be deterred from applying by the complicated application process or a lack of collaterals (transaction-cost constraints), or by high borrowing costs (price constraints), or the level of risk involved and which translates into the fear of losing the collaterals (risk constraints).

2677	Access to credit is viewed a treatment process through which benefitting farmers (the treated group) manage to circumvent the many constraints in the credit market, as opposed to farmers that are either deterred from applying for credit or unsuccessful when they manage to apply.

2906	"Fula society is patrilinear and patrilocal, so when a new family is constituted through marriage the women joins her husband family: according to current pulaar terminology, a men ""brings in the woman"" (mbo addii debbo)."	“Gender inequalities and development: a picture of Fula women in the border area of South-eastern Senegal through a gender analysis”	Giovanna Basso, Maria Sassi	2015
2907	Women have the charge of all domestic activities, to let men do house works, especially sweep the house, is considered a shame not only for the man but also for the woman herself.	“Gender inequalities and development: a picture of Fula women in the border area of South-eastern Senegal through a gender analysis”	Giovanna Basso, Maria Sassi	2015
2908	"According to the local cultural representations, in fact, a ""good woman"" should be able to take appropriate care of the house and of the family, expressed among other things in the quality of meals cooked for her husband: mothers teach how to cook to their daughters since an early age, punishing them (often physically) if the meal is not good enough, in order to make them ready to take proper care of their husbands."	“Gender inequalities and development: a picture of Fula women in the border area of South-eastern Senegal through a gender analysis”	Giovanna Basso, Maria Sassi	2015
2909	Polygyny is still largely practiced in the Kolda rural area, and according to Islamic religion a man should take as many women as he can sustain and he is supposed to treat them all equally.	“Gender inequalities and development: a picture of Fula women in the border area of South-eastern Senegal through a gender analysis”	Giovanna Basso, Maria Sassi	2015
2910	Polygyny is in some cases seen as a good option by women, that, as we saw, can share household life and work with other women, but can also rise serious problems, notably in case of unequal treatment of the wives from the part of the husband.	“Gender inequalities and development: a picture of Fula women in the border area of South-eastern Senegal through a gender analysis”	Giovanna Basso, Maria Sassi	2015
2911	Divorce, however, is considered a shame for a women, that will be highly stigmatized for not having been able to make the marriage work.	“Gender inequalities and development: a picture of Fula women in the border area of South-eastern Senegal through a gender analysis”	Giovanna Basso, Maria Sassi	2015
2912	A woman alone is considered highly vulnerable and unsecure: one woman told that after her husband died people started thieving her cattle taking advantage of her condition of woman without men in the household and with not grown up children, without any means to make justice.	“Gender inequalities and development: a picture of Fula women in the border area of South-eastern Senegal through a gender analysis”	Giovanna Basso, Maria Sassi	2015
2913	"Women without husband are considered not ""normal"" and marginalized, also through magic-religious arguments as the accusation of sorcery."	“Gender inequalities and development: a picture of Fula women in the border area of South-eastern Senegal through a gender analysis”	Giovanna Basso, Maria Sassi	2015

2915	During our discussion on this issue with women, many of them said people arrange marriages for their daughters in a early age for fear they will start to have sex for money or because keeping them in the household becomes too expensive.	“Gender inequalities and development: a picture of Fula women in the border area of South-eastern Senegal through a gender analysis”	Giovanna Basso, Maria Sassi	2015
2916	The women decided to stop the practice to protect the human rights and health of their daughters, and they went so far to announce their collective decision--a breakthrough for Senegal, where cutting was always considered mandatory for girls to marry.	“Gender inequalities and development: a picture of Fula women in the border area of South-eastern Senegal through a gender analysis”	Giovanna Basso, Maria Sassi	2015
2917	According to one study on the effectiveness of Tostan's educational programs (UNICEF, 2008), in villages where Tostan intervened, the percentage of women who approved of FGM decreased from 72% to 16%, and the percentage of girls between the ages of five and ten who had not been subjected to FGM increased from 21% to 49%.	“Gender inequalities and development: a picture of Fula women in the border area of South-eastern Senegal through a gender analysis”	Giovanna Basso, Maria Sassi	2015
2918	This was the only approach during colonial periods, and was favoured by many missionaries.	“Gender inequalities and development: a picture of Fula women in the border area of South-eastern Senegal through a gender analysis”	Giovanna Basso, Maria Sassi	2015
2919	The sample chosen for the first and second activity was constituted in each village (Salikegne, Guiro Yero Mandou, Darou Salam) of a group of 10 women, chosen among the beneficiaries of the project, and a group of 10 men, the women's husbands.	“Gender inequalities and development: a picture of Fula women in the border area of South-eastern Senegal through a gender analysis”	Giovanna Basso, Maria Sassi	2015

2921	"Concerning marriage of children, especially daughters, participants said it's both parents that decide to whom ""to give"" (""okkude"") the girl."	“Gender inequalities and development: a picture of Fula women in the border area of South-eastern Senegal through a gender analysis”	Giovanna Basso, Maria Sassi	2015
2922	Often the two issues of girls' marriage and school attendance overlap, since marriages are arranges when girls are still very young, and fathers often prefer to make them marry rather than finish school.	“Gender inequalities and development: a picture of Fula women in the border area of South-eastern Senegal through a gender analysis”	Giovanna Basso, Maria Sassi	2015
2923	"However, it's women that solicit their husband to intervene, being them who are more in contact with children and more aware of their conditions: as one woman said, ""if you wait for the man to take the child to the hospital, he will do it when he's already dead!"	“Gender inequalities and development: a picture of Fula women in the border area of South-eastern Senegal through a gender analysis”	Giovanna Basso, Maria Sassi	2015
2924	However, some women said they don't trust their husband and prefer to keep the money for fear he would not spend it for family needs but for his own interests.	“Gender inequalities and development: a picture of Fula women in the border area of South-eastern Senegal through a gender analysis”	Giovanna Basso, Maria Sassi	2015
2925	Women also said that rarely they know how much money their husbands have saved, since they tend to hide it to avoid requests from the family members.	“Gender inequalities and development: a picture of Fula women in the border area of South-eastern Senegal through a gender analysis”	Giovanna Basso, Maria Sassi	2015
2926	An old man stated that even if nowadays there are still some men that keep all the family savings and control all expenses, in general thins are changed and everybody tends to keep the money he or she earns, including children who go to work somewhere and when they go back home refuse to remit the money to their fathers.	“Gender inequalities and development: a picture of Fula women in the border area of South-eastern Senegal through a gender analysis”	Giovanna Basso, Maria Sassi	2015
2927	Traditionally women own one r more cow, since they receive a female cow from her husband at the moment of marriage.	“Gender inequalities and development: a picture of Fula women in the border area of South-eastern Senegal through a gender analysis”	Giovanna Basso, Maria Sassi	2015
2928	Men underlined that it's impossible for a woman to go to the market to sell a cow, cause nobody would buy a cow from a woman.	“Gender inequalities and development: a picture of Fula women in the border area of South-eastern Senegal through a gender analysis”	Giovanna Basso, Maria Sassi	2015
2929	"Women control all the process of rice production, even if during workshop discussion some men argued that once the harvested rice enters the hous, they actually have the control of it and its use, holding the head of the household the ""key of the granary""."	“Gender inequalities and development: a picture of Fula women in the border area of South-eastern Senegal through a gender analysis”	Giovanna Basso, Maria Sassi	2015
2930	Traditionally the rice field, faaro, belonged to the whole family, and man farmed one part (maarou) while his wives the others (kamagnan)18.	“Gender inequalities and development: a picture of Fula women in the border area of South-eastern Senegal through a gender analysis”	Giovanna Basso, Maria Sassi	2015
2931	Vegetables mostly grown are onion, chili, jaxatu, okra (kanje), sorrel (follere), tomatoes, cabbage.	“Gender inequalities and development: a picture of Fula women in the border area of South-eastern Senegal through a gender analysis”	Giovanna Basso, Maria Sassi	2015
2932	Men tended to give less weight to women participation to community meetings, arguing that even when they are open to women also, it's men that represent their household and take any decision.	“Gender inequalities and development: a picture of Fula women in the border area of South-eastern Senegal through a gender analysis”	Giovanna Basso, Maria Sassi	2015
2933	On the other hand, women of Guiro Yero Mandou argued being able to participate and express themselves in all kinds of meetings.	“Gender inequalities and development: a picture of Fula women in the border area of South-eastern Senegal through a gender analysis”	Giovanna Basso, Maria Sassi	2015
2934	However, during joint discussion with both men and women, women also agreed that they actually have freedom of expression only in meetings reserved to them (mainly sensitizations and campaigns of Ngos), and that they can participate only after the consent	“Gender inequalities and development: a picture of Fula women in the border area of South-eastern Senegal through a gender analysis”	Giovanna Basso, Maria Sassi	2015
2935	"Another example is offered by one of the presidents who joined the focus group we held on FGM and early marriages, that before starting speaking greeted everybody and thanked her husband ""because without his consent I would not be here today""."	“Gender inequalities and development: a picture of Fula women in the border area of South-eastern Senegal through a gender analysis”	Giovanna Basso, Maria Sassi	2015
2936	However, some man argued that they don't let their wives go alone to meet the Jarga, for fear she gives a partial version of the story.	“Gender inequalities and development: a picture of Fula women in the border area of South-eastern Senegal through a gender analysis”	Giovanna Basso, Maria Sassi	2015
2937	In particular, women, that after marriage leave to join their husband village, usually have a referent person of their family in that village, that is supposed to watch over her and intervene in case of maltreatment from the part of the husband or his family.	“Gender inequalities and development: a picture of Fula women in the border area of South-eastern Senegal through a gender analysis”	Giovanna Basso, Maria Sassi	2015
2938	"As the participants pointed out, usually women and men wake up between 5am and 6am (in the ""maraboutique"" villages for praying the subaka at 6am) , women start sweeping the courtyard and the house, then doing other house works according to the period of the year."	“Gender inequalities and development: a picture of Fula women in the border area of South-eastern Senegal through a gender analysis”	Giovanna Basso, Maria Sassi	2015
2939	They then prepare breakfast, usually rice with baobab leaves in the rainy season, but cous cous made of other cereals in the rest of the year.	“Gender inequalities and development: a picture of Fula women in the border area of South-eastern Senegal through a gender analysis”	Giovanna Basso, Maria Sassi	2015
2940	So women usually organize themselves dividing their tasks: one prepares breakfast, one lunch and one dinner and in the rest of time she goes to take care of rice fields or garden.	“Gender inequalities and development: a picture of Fula women in the border area of South-eastern Senegal through a gender analysis”	Giovanna Basso, Maria Sassi	2015
2941	Their comments make reference to poverty and tradition: men acknowledge that women burden is extremely heavy but don't feel responsible for it, seeing poverty as the problem: the only possible way to change the situation seems to be to marry more than one women in order to allow them to share tasks, or to hire a servant if it were possible, while involving men in house activities is never taken into consideration.	“Gender inequalities and development: a picture of Fula women in the border area of South-eastern Senegal through a gender analysis”	Giovanna Basso, Maria Sassi	2015
2942	In fact, gender roles are strictly defined by tradition, according to which men are supposed to take home the means of leaving and women to take care of the household and reproduction.	“Gender inequalities and development: a picture of Fula women in the border area of South-eastern Senegal through a gender analysis”	Giovanna Basso, Maria Sassi	2015
2943	Women themselves affirm that even if their husbands accepted to participate in domestic activities, it would be a shame for them to let them do things like sweeping: it would imply that they are not good	“Gender inequalities and development: a picture of Fula women in the border area of South-eastern Senegal through a gender analysis”	Giovanna Basso, Maria Sassi	2015
2944	Many women also share the thought that their husbands don't help because of poverty, not because of a lack of willingness to make their lives better.	“Gender inequalities and development: a picture of Fula women in the border area of South-eastern Senegal through a gender analysis”	Giovanna Basso, Maria Sassi	2015
2945	The focus group with the nine presidents of the Comites de gestion of the community vegetable gardens was thought as a space to let women discuss among themselves about more relevant problems that women face in their communities, and to explore the perception of participants about issues at the center of development discourse, as female genital mutilations (FGM), early marriages, violence against women, addressing them in a smaller group and more familiar context.	“Gender inequalities and development: a picture of Fula women in the border area of South-eastern Senegal through a gender analysis”	Giovanna Basso, Maria Sassi	2015
2946	Early marriage, finally, is not much perceived as a problem but as a solution, to avoid early pregnancies and commercial sex from the part of young girls.	“Gender inequalities and development: a picture of Fula women in the border area of South-eastern Senegal through a gender analysis”	Giovanna Basso, Maria Sassi	2015
2947	Many spoke about the absence of their husbands in the care work, especially of children, seen as a responsibility women have to carry on their shoulders alone.	“Gender inequalities and development: a picture of Fula women in the border area of South-eastern Senegal through a gender analysis”	Giovanna Basso, Maria Sassi	2015
2948	"Women feel the burden of providing to everyday needs of their children alone, in conditions of restricted economic means (""hay huunde yonaani"", ""nothis is enough""), starting from food: one woman reports that she has to struggle everyday to find something to cook to accompany rice, since her husband leaves her only white rice at morning, then complaining if the meal is not good enough."	“Gender inequalities and development: a picture of Fula women in the border area of South-eastern Senegal through a gender analysis”	Giovanna Basso, Maria Sassi	2015
2949	"They feel alone with their worries on children health, school attendance, controlling the sexuality of young girls, complaining that husbands ""don't care at all about children, just use marriage for sex""."	“Gender inequalities and development: a picture of Fula women in the border area of South-eastern Senegal through a gender analysis”	Giovanna Basso, Maria Sassi	2015
2950	"No matter how hard marriage can be, interrupting it is hardly a possible way out: divorce is highly socially stigmatized and a women leaving her husband is always seen as the responsible of conflict and rupture, thus considered a ""bad woman""."	“Gender inequalities and development: a picture of Fula women in the border area of South-eastern Senegal through a gender analysis”	Giovanna Basso, Maria Sassi	2015
2951	"Participants reported innumerable stories from their villages related to violence against women, as part of everyday life: ""the day before yesterday a men beat his wife because he was jealous."	“Gender inequalities and development: a picture of Fula women in the border area of South-eastern Senegal through a gender analysis”	Giovanna Basso, Maria Sassi	2015
2952	"However, physical violence is perceived as less hurting than other forms of violence : ""if a man beats you, you will hurt for some hours and then recover, but if he tells you mean words you will hurt forever"""	“Gender inequalities and development: a picture of Fula women in the border area of South-eastern Senegal through a gender analysis”	Giovanna Basso, Maria Sassi	2015
2953	When asked if violence against women is a reality in their villages, most of the participants reported types of violence not physical, mostly related to unequal treatment among wives and discrimination, generally of first wife/ves in favour of the newly married one, despite Islamic religion asserting that a man should take as many women as he can sustain and he is supposed to treat them all equally.	“Gender inequalities and development: a picture of Fula women in the border area of South-eastern Senegal through a gender analysis”	Giovanna Basso, Maria Sassi	2015
2954	As the story shows, being neglected by one's husband, who doesn't eat what she prepares and doesn't sleep with her, is considered a shame for a woman, a failure of her role of good wife, that also defines her as good woman.	“Gender inequalities and development: a picture of Fula women in the border area of South-eastern Senegal through a gender analysis”	Giovanna Basso, Maria Sassi	2015
2955	When asked about sexual harassment and violence against young girls, participants reported many cases and showed a great concern about impunity of those acts : it seems that in many cases, after sexual violence occurs, parents prefer to impose to the perpetrator to marry the victim, instead of prosecuting him:	“Gender inequalities and development: a picture of Fula women in the border area of South-eastern Senegal through a gender analysis”	Giovanna Basso, Maria Sassi	2015
2956	However, it is not much perceived as problem affecting girls' lives and capability to choose, but rather as a solution to preserve girls' honor and family reputation, preventing them to get pregnant and practice commercial sex.	“Gender inequalities and development: a picture of Fula women in the border area of South-eastern Senegal through a gender analysis”	Giovanna Basso, Maria Sassi	2015
2957	Even though women generally recognize that girls should go to school and get a minimum of instruction before marrying, they see school also a place of threats:	“Gender inequalities and development: a picture of Fula women in the border area of South-eastern Senegal through a gender analysis”	Giovanna Basso, Maria Sassi	2015
2958	"Women affirm that early marriage is a safe way to prevent girls to make resort to commercial sex for satisfying her needs, and that an alternative solution to preserve their virginity and thus family reputation could be more communication and better education from the part of mothers, especially sexual education, in a logic of re-establishing good social norms and ""costumes"" of the elders:"	“Gender inequalities and development: a picture of Fula women in the border area of South-eastern Senegal through a gender analysis”	Giovanna Basso, Maria Sassi	2015
2959	All women point out before starting speaking that this practice belongs to the past, that now everybody is aware of risks and consequences of female circumcision, arguing that circumcision practitioners stopped working following sensitization campaigns as those mentioned before undertaken by the Ngo Tostan within a UNICEF/UNFA campaign, which seems to have had a large impact in Kolda region.	“Gender inequalities and development: a picture of Fula women in the border area of South-eastern Senegal through a gender analysis”	Giovanna Basso, Maria Sassi	2015
2960	Kambua, for example, is one of the villages that signed a Public Declaration to abandon FGM and early marriages, that seems to work thanks to social pressure mechanisms, as the representative of Kambua said:	“Gender inequalities and development: a picture of Fula women in the border area of South-eastern Senegal through a gender analysis”	Giovanna Basso, Maria Sassi	2015
2961	Despite such an emphasis on change, FGM still occur, and some of the participants themselves affirm having circumcised their daughters : one, an elderly woman, justifies herself saying that at the time she did it, long time ago, she was not aware it was a dangerous practice, and the other, quite young, said she had to do it to comply with her husband will.21	“Gender inequalities and development: a picture of Fula women in the border area of South-eastern Senegal through a gender analysis”	Giovanna Basso, Maria Sassi	2015
2962	According to women reports, if it's true that many village don't have any longer a circumcision practitioner, it's also frequent that women take daughters to villages where they can find one, especially in Guinea Bissau where FGM are not banned:	“Gender inequalities and development: a picture of Fula women in the border area of South-eastern Senegal through a gender analysis”	Giovanna Basso, Maria Sassi	2015
2963	At the moment of marriage the husband traditionally has to give to his wife a plot of land for rice culture, and if his family doesn't have land available he is supposed to borrow some land.	“Gender inequalities and development: a picture of Fula women in the border area of South-eastern Senegal through a gender analysis”	Giovanna Basso, Maria Sassi	2015
2964	Anyway it is considered culturally inappropriate for women to be involved in the purchase or sell of livestock, including in some cases poultry, and of any other valuable resources.	“Gender inequalities and development: a picture of Fula women in the border area of South-eastern Senegal through a gender analysis”	Giovanna Basso, Maria Sassi	2015
2965	In fact, as many Senegalese intellectuals pointed out (Diaw, 2011, Sarr Sow, 2014), in some cases in pre-colonial societies (Saloum, Rip, Waalo) women's social and political role was highly recognized (i.e.	“Gender inequalities and development: a picture of Fula women in the border area of South-eastern Senegal through a gender analysis”	Giovanna Basso, Maria Sassi	2015
2966	"As a woman said during the focus group on women's problems: ""With the Government of Macky Sall women now work, they can go to the rice field, cook dinner, but also work."	“Gender inequalities and development: a picture of Fula women in the border area of South-eastern Senegal through a gender analysis”	Giovanna Basso, Maria Sassi	2015
2967	As Nadine Sieveking argues in her paper on local reinterpretation of development concepts by Senegalese women (Sieveking, 2007), women ask for the acknowledgment of their workload, duties and responsibilities, but still accepting that those duties and moral responsibilities should be different from those of men.	“Gender inequalities and development: a picture of Fula women in the border area of South-eastern Senegal through a gender analysis”	Giovanna Basso, Maria Sassi	2015
2968	Women of the rural area of Southern Kolda region, even young girls, generally see in marriage and reproduction the major achievement of their life.	“Gender inequalities and development: a picture of Fula women in the border area of South-eastern Senegal through a gender analysis”	Giovanna Basso, Maria Sassi	2015
2969	"Introduction At the turn of the 21st century, public opinion in Europe expressed great concern about sub-Saharan migration: media images of migrants assaulting the Spanish Ceuta and Melilla enclaves in Morocco and of packed pirogues barely arriving on the Spanish coasts raised fears of ""invasion""."	New patterns of migration between Senegal and Europe	Cris Beauchemin, Papa Sakho, Bruno Schoumaker, Marie-Laurence Flahaux	2015
2970	But despite the power of frightening images of migrants dying or fighting at Europe's borders, previous research has shown that the feared invasion is nothing but a myth: Sub-Saharans form a minority of migrant stocks and flows in Europe, even when estimates of irregular migration are included (de Haas 2008; Lessault and Beauchemin 2009).	New patterns of migration between Senegal and Europe	Cris Beauchemin, Papa Sakho, Bruno Schoumaker, Marie-Laurence Flahaux	2015
2971	According to Tall and Tandian (2011), migration was reported as early as 1900 among the Soninke and from about 1910 among the Tukolor (Halpulaar).	New patterns of migration between Senegal and Europe	Cris Beauchemin, Papa Sakho, Bruno Schoumaker, Marie-Laurence Flahaux	2015
2972	Although the devaluation of the CFA franc (Senegal's currency) in 1994 generated an economic recovery (with a moderate increase in GDP per capita and a fall in urban poverty), most of the Senegalese population did not perceive any positive change in their well-being (Mezger 2012).	New patterns of migration between Senegal and Europe	Cris Beauchemin, Papa Sakho, Bruno Schoumaker, Marie-Laurence Flahaux	2015
2973	In any case, statistics agree in showing that there was no sudden exodus out of Dakar or more generally out of Senegal, even in the 2000s when media attention was captivated by pirogues loaded with sub-Saharan migrants reaching the Spanish coasts.	New patterns of migration between Senegal and Europe	Cris Beauchemin, Papa Sakho, Bruno Schoumaker, Marie-Laurence Flahaux	2015
2974	Indeed, when asked in the MAFE biographic survey about the motives for their return, migrants back in Senegal mainly reported family reasons (34%), the second most frequent reason being the completion of their studies (15%).	New patterns of migration between Senegal and Europe	Cris Beauchemin, Papa Sakho, Bruno Schoumaker, Marie-Laurence Flahaux	2015
2975	However, at the turn of the 21st century, socio-anthropologists pointed to a new attitude to return among communities of Wolof in Italy and of Tukolor and Soninke from the Senegal Valley in France (Sinatti, 2009; Sarr, 2010): return seems to be continually postponed as conditions in host countries make it increasingly difficult to fulfil hopes for economic success, which is a precondition for fulfilling family obligations and for a socially successful return home.	New patterns of migration between Senegal and Europe	Cris Beauchemin, Papa Sakho, Bruno Schoumaker, Marie-Laurence Flahaux	2015
2976	In addition, 16% were said to be indecisive whether to come back or stay abroad.	New patterns of migration between Senegal and Europe	Cris Beauchemin, Papa Sakho, Bruno Schoumaker, Marie-Laurence Flahaux	2015
2977	Cote d'Ivoire and Gabon, hit by economic decline, adopted policies in favour of their own citizens, and a xenophobic social ambience discouraged immigration and even encouraged return (Ba 1997; Blion and Bredeloup 1997).	New patterns of migration between Senegal and Europe	Cris Beauchemin, Papa Sakho, Bruno Schoumaker, Marie-Laurence Flahaux	2015
2978	These network effects are generally supposed to be especially strong in cases where migrants leave behind their close relatives (spouses, children): the right to family reunification, granted in all democracies (though with more or less liberal approaches), is a vector for continuing migration even when policies are restrictive (Boyd 1989).	New patterns of migration between Senegal and Europe	Cris Beauchemin, Papa Sakho, Bruno Schoumaker, Marie-Laurence Flahaux	2015
2979	When asked the reasons why they chosen their destination in Europe, 31 to 44% of migrants interviewed in France, Italy and Spain said they had social connections there (Table 5).	New patterns of migration between Senegal and Europe	Cris Beauchemin, Papa Sakho, Bruno Schoumaker, Marie-Laurence Flahaux	2015

2981	However, although it is often believed that transit countries are only located in African countries (Castagnone 2011), it is interesting to note that France is also a transit country for migrants heading to Southern Europe: 15% of the Senegalese migrants in Italy entered Europe through France, the proportion being much lower in Spain (3%, Table 9).

3734	Services tend to be delivered during the rainy season, but farmers would prefer to receive such information throughout the year (WFP and ANACIM, 2018[45]).	LESSONS ON ENGAGING WITH THE PRIVATE SECTOR TO STRENGTHEN CLIMATE RESILIENCE IN SENEGAL	Jorge Moreira da Silva	2021
3735	For example, the USAID is supporting ANACIM to develop a push alert system in French, Wolof, Peulh, Serere and other local languages for farmers (either by SMS, which are preferred as they can be shared with other farmers, or by calls for illiterate farmers).	LESSONS ON ENGAGING WITH THE PRIVATE SECTOR TO STRENGTHEN CLIMATE RESILIENCE IN SENEGAL	Jorge Moreira da Silva	2021
3736	Other farmers may prefer receiving the information through TV and radio forecasts - but delivering climate services through these means cannot be rolled out across the country, as there are limits to the network coverage, including of mobile technology (WFP and ANACIM, 2018[45]).

3739	Index-based insurance is widely perceived as a particularly effective means of providing insurance in developing countries because it lowers assessment costs and reduces the moral hazard associated with traditional insurance contracts (Schaefer and Waters, 2016[59]).	LESSONS ON ENGAGING WITH THE PRIVATE SECTOR TO STRENGTHEN CLIMATE RESILIENCE IN SENEGAL	Jorge Moreira da Silva	2021
3740	These are necessary because many farmers still have no or limited understanding of insurance, and mistrust future insurance pay-outs, especially in index-based insurance.	LESSONS ON ENGAGING WITH THE PRIVATE SECTOR TO STRENGTHEN CLIMATE RESILIENCE IN SENEGAL	Jorge Moreira da Silva	2021
3741	A recent gendered assessment found that while men in Senegal were interested in insurance, women were more concerned with shocks to health and other issues affecting income levels and thus favoured savings-based instruments over index-based insurance.

3803	There is a clear perception that fertilizer subsidies can improve the use of the input and overall agricultural productivity.	Fertilizer Subsidy and Agricultural Productivity in Senegal	Abdoulaye Seck	2017
3804	The survey collected detailed information on more than 180 farmers and reveals that about half of these farmers benefit from the subsidy program, with a price coverage ratio ranging from 5 to 100 percent.	Fertilizer Subsidy and Agricultural Productivity in Senegal	Abdoulaye Seck	2017
3805	Rice, which is the main staple food in Senegal, was targeted to increase production from 195,000 metric tons in 2007-2008 to 500,000 metric tons to 2008-2009, an increase of 156 percent.	Fertilizer Subsidy and Agricultural Productivity in Senegal	Abdoulaye Seck	2017
3806	REVA aims to improve rural agricultural infrastructure and encourage young farmers and female farmers through training and the provision of tools and equipment.	Fertilizer Subsidy and Agricultural Productivity in Senegal	Abdoulaye Seck	2017
3807	However, there is a wide belief that not all farmers are treated equally: larger, market-oriented farms with greater political or economic bargaining power are believed to benefit the most from the program in terms of quantity, quality, and timing compared to smaller, subsistence family farms.	Fertilizer Subsidy and Agricultural Productivity in Senegal	Abdoulaye Seck	2017
3808	One of the non-parametric approaches to estimating productivity is known as the data envelopment analysis (DEA), which is very popular in evaluating firms' performance (Cooper et al., 2007).	Fertilizer Subsidy and Agricultural Productivity in Senegal	Abdoulaye Seck	2017
3809	Farmers were scattered over three main rural communities: Diama (62.3 percent), Gandom (19.6 percent), and Ronkh (19.1 percent).	Fertilizer Subsidy and Agricultural Productivity in Senegal	Abdoulaye Seck	2017
3810	For the average farmer, the activity on the current land has been going on for nearly three decades; this was a decade shorter than the length of farming experience.	Fertilizer Subsidy and Agricultural Productivity in Senegal	Abdoulaye Seck	2017

3813	More than 62 percent of farmers cultivated at least two distinct pieces of land.	Fertilizer Subsidy and Agricultural Productivity in Senegal	Abdoulaye Seck	2017
3814	Rice was by far the most popular crop, occupying more than 58 percent of all land.	Fertilizer Subsidy and Agricultural Productivity in Senegal	Abdoulaye Seck	2017
3815	More than two-thirds (67.7 percent) of farmers self-financed their own investment through non-distributed profits.	Fertilizer Subsidy and Agricultural Productivity in Senegal	Abdoulaye Seck	2017
3816	A large majority of farmers (61.9 percent) who sold in the domestic markets did so indirectly, using a vast network of intermediaries; this indicates that they did not capture the full market value of their products.

3817	In addition, the vast majority of farmers sold product unprocessed.	Fertilizer Subsidy and Agricultural Productivity in Senegal	Abdoulaye Seck	2017
3818	Only 20.6 percent of farmers possessed processing facilities, further suggesting that a significant portion of the value chain was still out of the farmers' hands.	Fertilizer Subsidy and Agricultural Productivity in Senegal	Abdoulaye Seck	2017
3819	Of the 179 farmers surveyed who used fertilizers, more than half have benefitted from the subsidy programs.	Fertilizer Subsidy and Agricultural Productivity in Senegal	Abdoulaye Seck	2017
3820	On average, farmers use 25.9 kg of fertilizer per hectare, and the data indicate a significant amount of heterogeneity in demand.	Fertilizer Subsidy and Agricultural Productivity in Senegal	Abdoulaye Seck	2017
3821	In effect, farmers who benefit from the program use on average 28.4 kg/ha, compared to 23.3 kg/ha for nonbeneficiaries, suggesting that the reduction in price as a result of the subsidy tends to encourage farmers to purchase more fertilizer.	Fertilizer Subsidy and Agricultural Productivity in Senegal	Abdoulaye Seck	2017
3822	However, farmers surveyed in this study tend to be of small size and with relatively little variation.	Fertilizer Subsidy and Agricultural Productivity in Senegal	Abdoulaye Seck	2017

3860	"The creation of the Laiterie du Berger in 2006 grew out of an observation made by its founder Bagore Bathily, a veterinarian by training: ""90% of the milk sold on the Senegalese market is imported."	Developing local dairy production: the Laiterie du Berger, Senegal	Merryl Parisse	2019
3861	The Laiterie du Berger seeks to create value with local milk, mainly by producing yogurt from fresh milk.	Developing local dairy production: the Laiterie du Berger, Senegal	Merryl Parisse	2019
3862	"As the only industry in Senegal producing yogurt from collected milk, LDB has taken on a sizeable challenge, which has earned it the attention of several international groups and the status of ""social business"" (deined by Professor Yunus as a non-loss, non-dividend company focused on a social objective)."	Developing local dairy production: the Laiterie du Berger, Senegal	Merryl Parisse	2019
3863	The towns of Richard Toll and Dagana, and the weekly markets of Niassante, Bokhul and Diagle, are active trading hubs for farmers who live in isolated compounds.	Developing local dairy production: the Laiterie du Berger, Senegal	Merryl Parisse	2019
3864	Also, it is preferable if the churns are full, and therefore that several farmers contribute to the same churn.	Developing local dairy production: the Laiterie du Berger, Senegal	Merryl Parisse	2019
3865	The farmers are not fully satisied with the collection system: half of them declare that they have had problems with their churn (bad cover, milk lost, insuficient number of churns...).	Developing local dairy production: the Laiterie du Berger, Senegal	Merryl Parisse	2019
3866	It is important for the collector (who acts as the farmers' spokesman vis-a-vis the Laiterie du Berger) to help keep account of volumes per churn in order to avoid conlicts, as most of the farmers cannot read their monthly statements.	Developing local dairy production: the Laiterie du Berger, Senegal	Merryl Parisse	2019
3867	Churn-sharing (where multiple cattle-owners contribute to the same churn), while useful for LDB, is therefore often problematic for the farmers, who will only agree to share with family members whom they really trust.	Developing local dairy production: the Laiterie du Berger, Senegal	Merryl Parisse	2019
3868	This is the main source of discontent among the farmers, who are discouraged from supplying milk when the money is not forthcoming.	Developing local dairy production: the Laiterie du Berger, Senegal	Merryl Parisse	2019
3869	"Milk therefore covered part of the ""daily spend"": 50% of the respondent farmers said that it was a proitable business, but it remains a tiring activity (carrying dairy products to market in a calabash, waiting in the sun, etc.)"	Developing local dairy production: the Laiterie du Berger, Senegal	Merryl Parisse	2019
3870	In the dry season, when milk is scarce, a liter fetches a good price at the market, but during the rainy season, milk becomes so abundant that it loses all value: the farmers cannot even sell off their surplus.	Developing local dairy production: the Laiterie du Berger, Senegal	Merryl Parisse	2019
3871	The arrival of the Laiterie du Berger enabled these farmers to ind a buyer for their production at a period - the rainy season - when it had no commercial value.	Developing local dairy production: the Laiterie du Berger, Senegal	Merryl Parisse	2019
3872	Fewer farmers supply the Dairy during the dry season.	Developing local dairy production: the Laiterie du Berger, Senegal	Merryl Parisse	2019
3873	There are certainly some practical constraints involved here: the cows dry up during the dry season, and some farmers move away with their herds to other pastures, but there is also a degree of opportunism on the part of some farmers, who take advantage of the relative scarcity of milk during the dry season to sell their milk for a better price at the weekly market.	Developing local dairy production: the Laiterie du Berger, Senegal	Merryl Parisse	2019
3874	In light of the traditional uses of milk (home consumption, barter) and farmers' cattle selling strategies (the herd must not be reduced unless absolutely necessary), it would be inappropriate to speak about poverty to describe the farmers' situation.	Developing local dairy production: the Laiterie du Berger, Senegal	Merryl Parisse	2019
3875	On average farmers supply 11.2 l per day in the wet season (for an average monthly income of FCFA 56,000, or euro85/$111) and 5 l during the dry season	Developing local dairy production: the Laiterie du Berger, Senegal	Merryl Parisse	2019
3876	The price offered by LDB (200 FCFA unchanged since 2006) is considered as insuficient as compared to the traditional markets' price even though it can hardly be compared (the factory buys raw milk at their door while what is sold at the market is butter and the farmers have to walk there).	Developing local dairy production: the Laiterie du Berger, Senegal	Merryl Parisse	2019
3877	The reliability of this data is, however, questionable: herd size is a taboo question among farmers (9% of the farmers interviewed refused to answer that question) and many of them really do not count their cattle (some gave approximate or inconsistent igures).	Developing local dairy production: the Laiterie du Berger, Senegal	Merryl Parisse	2019
3878	For example, almost all of the farmers who said they no longer had any bulls or bull calves had sold them to go on pilgrimage to Mecca.	Developing local dairy production: the Laiterie du Berger, Senegal	Merryl Parisse	2019

3880	Of the suppliers interviewed, 63% said that they migrate with their cattle, but only 11% travel with the whole herd outside the collection area.	Developing local dairy production: the Laiterie du Berger, Senegal	Merryl Parisse	2019
3881	Some farmers, for example, keep dairy cows in the village so that they can continue to sell milk to LDB (category B).	Developing local dairy production: the Laiterie du Berger, Senegal	Merryl Parisse	2019
3882	During the dry season, 21% of the respondent farmers feed their animals a combination of concentrate and forage, 73% distribute concentrate only (often the product sold by the plant), while 2.4% make do with forage alone and 3% give them nothing.	Developing local dairy production: the Laiterie du Berger, Senegal	Merryl Parisse	2019
3883	Those who combine concentrate and forage supply more milk than average, and 39% of the respondent farmers say that calving has increased since they started using feed.	Developing local dairy production: the Laiterie du Berger, Senegal	Merryl Parisse	2019
3884	The feeding of cattle in the dry season is a fairly new phenomenon; previously, farmers preferred to set offin search of new pasture.	Developing local dairy production: the Laiterie du Berger, Senegal	Merryl Parisse	2019
3885	Yet 75% of the interviewed farmers complain about LDB's food distribution system.	Developing local dairy production: the Laiterie du Berger, Senegal	Merryl Parisse	2019
3886	Even though they have recognized the need of feeding their cattle, they say the quotas system (based on milk delivery) is not eficient, the transport from Richard Toll to their village is expensive, and LDB had some shortage of feed at critical times.	Developing local dairy production: the Laiterie du Berger, Senegal	Merryl Parisse	2019
3887	Food distribution is a crucial service, often cited by the farmers as the main advantage of delivering to the factory, and LDB could improve the organization of this service in order to insure the volume of milk provided during the dry season and to keep its farmers all year long.	Developing local dairy production: the Laiterie du Berger, Senegal	Merryl Parisse	2019
3888	The Laiterie du Berger therefore provides better visibility of the needs of Senegal's dairy producers, and a window on the outside world for farmers who live in often very isolated areas.	Developing local dairy production: the Laiterie du Berger, Senegal	Merryl Parisse	2019
3889	And 19% are even thinking about switching to modern cattle-farming techniques: keeping a few good dairy cows, sedentarizing them, building pens and sheds, and providing them with feed.	Developing local dairy production: the Laiterie du Berger, Senegal	Merryl Parisse	2019
3890	Thierno Idrissa Sow, a farmer from the village of Kouel, told us in an interview that he does not want to take the risk of investing in a well or a dairy shed, because he lacks technical advice and because he has no way of knowing what the future has in store for him.	Developing local dairy production: the Laiterie du Berger, Senegal	Merryl Parisse	2019
3891	The farmers' perceptions of their collaboration with LDB, and their satisfaction levels, are far from incidental; they have a direct inluence on the volumes of milk supplied.	Developing local dairy production: the Laiterie du Berger, Senegal	Merryl Parisse	2019
3892	The average monthly income of LDB's farmers is estimated at FCFA 41,500, with some of them earning over FCFA 100,000.	Developing local dairy production: the Laiterie du Berger, Senegal	Merryl Parisse	2019
3893	Yet the unchanged price paid per liter since 2006 is often considered too low by the farmers.	Developing local dairy production: the Laiterie du Berger, Senegal	Merryl Parisse	2019
3894	Secondly, the farmers are changing their practices: the possibility to sell their milk has given them incentives to enhance their milk production, sedentarizying their cattle and feeding them during the dry season.	Developing local dairy production: the Laiterie du Berger, Senegal	Merryl Parisse	2019
3895	Whereas the traditional practices seemed constrictive, the partnership with the Laiterie du Berger offers farmers a wider range of choices.	Developing local dairy production: the Laiterie du Berger, Senegal	Merryl Parisse	2019
3896	Likewise for the herdsmen who used to cover vast distances across the bush in search of pasture during the dry season: 77% of the respondent farmers have now sedentarized at least their dairy cows (40%) or even their entire herd (37%).	Developing local dairy production: the Laiterie du Berger, Senegal	Merryl Parisse	2019
3897	The LDB with its partners have initiated some services (deferred grazing and artiicial insemination), offering farmers a glimpse of the development potential of their activity; but access to water remains the absolute pre-condition for enabling cows to produce milk in greater quantity.

3898	In Senegal, agriculture is among the most important users of groundwater resources, especially in the northern coastal area called 'Niayes' where farmers practice irrigated agriculture and use almost exclusively the quarternary sand aquifer for their irrigation needs during the dry season - which is the main growing period.

3900	Due to low level 71 of annual rainfalls, farmers specialize in irrigated agriculture during the dry season that is the 72 main growing season4 during which are grown most of horticultural crops in Senegal.	Rainfall variability and groundwater availability for irrigation in Sub-Saharan Africa: evidence from the Niayes region of Senegal	Amy Faye, Siwa Msangi	2019
3901	There is a small proportion of farmers 80 (less than 3%) in the South of the Niayes that access water through the Senegalese water 81 company (SONES).

3902	The reason for 544 this choice is that since farmers' water extractions are lower in the dynamic case, we prefer 545 using the latter to explore farmers' responses in order to avoid any overestimation of simulated 546 adaptation strategies.

3903	As a result, 664 farmers value the availability of the resource in the future and thus decrease their withdrawals 665 in the dynamic case which improves the availability of the groundwater reflected in a lower 666 aquifer lift with lower interest rates (see figure 9).

3912	"According to an enquiry in ""Le Nouvel Horizon"" the risk for a caste person of not being elected is still high In the ""Fouta"" or Wolof countries, it is not rare to see activists of some political party not allowed to speak at meetings, because, traditionally they were not entitled to speak in public gatherings."

3968	For twenty years, the river's annual flood would be artificially maintained, to allow for traditional flood-recession farming, but the level of flooding would be reduced from year to year; by the end of the twenty-year period, it was expected that the entire population of the valley would be engaged in irrigated farming (PNUD-OMVS, 1974).

3971	Irrigation networks were built on the light soils of the river bank, which were not highly valued in the traditional system of agriculture and were thus generally available for irrigation.	The Senegal River: Flood management and the future of the valley	Adrian Adams	2000
3972	Delta land requires a level of investment which few of its present users, whether peasant farmers or or private developers , seem able to achieve.	The Senegal River: Flood management and the future of the valley	Adrian Adams	2000
3973	In the Valley, as opposed to the Delta, applications for land come mainly from local residents: traditional leaders, traders, men working abroad, who register of their family's land in their own names, thus using their traditional rights as a launching-pad for commercial agriculture, usually on fairly small irrigation schemes.

3974	In 1990, despite drought and the almost total failure of rainfed crops, OMVS decided not to release any water at all, but to retain all the water to test the reservoir's storage capacity.	The Senegal River: Flood management and the future of the valley	Adrian Adams	2000
3975	But all OMVS wanted to do was keep the water level in the reservoir at around 206 metres above sea level; once this had been achieved, they reduced then stopped the release of water.	The Senegal River: Flood management and the future of the valley	Adrian Adams	2000

3977	When the results of IDA's work were presented at a seminar in Dakar in November 1990, they were favourably received by the Senegalese government, which, with its Left-Bank Master Plan (Plan Directeur de la Rive Gauche), was about to opt for maintaining a yearly artificial flood.	The Senegal River: Flood management and the future of the valley	Adrian Adams	2000
3978	"Moreover, the IDA's hydrology expert was advised that it was ""dangerous"" to raise questions about artificial flooding, as farmers might begin to think they were entitled to it."	The Senegal River: Flood management and the future of the valley	Adrian Adams	2000

3985	It would have been better to make a thorough examination of the alternatives - natural gas from Diamnadio, the hydro-electric resources of the Gambia River, reducing the price of fuel by doing away with state subsidies to the Societe Africaine de Raffinage - before embarking on a project the costs of which (both direct and, as we shall see, indirect) are very high, and the profitability less certain than one is led to believe.	The Senegal River: Flood management and the future of the valley	Adrian Adams	2000
3986	According to a rapid survey of SAED agents and people living near low-lying depressions, this flood was generally judged satisfactory from the point of view of the area flooded, although in the Matam area it was considered to have been of too brief duration to flood local depressions effectively.

4025	This group of people remains negatively oriented in terms of purchasing in MGs' network because they don't give any value to social and environmental issues when choosing where to buy their vegetables, but the evidence that they do not know MG network could suggest they are a good group to be sensitized in order to engage in MGs, by communicating with them and involving them in MGs' initiatives.

4031	In fact, in a relatively poor and residential district such as Camberene, people are more used to rely on UPA products and therefore are more sensitive to UPA related social and environmental values, as also reported by other studies (Marumo and Mabuza, 2018).

4184	On the other hand, some farmers have shied away from adopting the drip system because its maintenance costs balance out the benefits of more efficient water use, and continue to use the traditional manual irrigation method.	Impact assessment of the initiative “Sector Country Programme – Agriculture and Rural Development in Senegal (2014-2018)”		2021
4185	The greatest difficulties encountered in adopting innovative production techniques are access to water, which many farmers in the central regions consider too expensive, and inadequate maintenance and repair of farm equipment.	Impact assessment of the initiative “Sector Country Programme – Agriculture and Rural Development in Senegal (2014-2018)”		2021
4186	In practice, those farmers who are best equipped technically and economically are able to overcome these shortcomings, while those who need help the most are discouraged and forego assistance from the project, which therefore has a marginal effect on food insecurity and rural poverty.

4285	While Senegal is proud of having the second most developed food-processing industry in West Africa, up to 70 per cent of input use in the formal sector is imported.	BUsIness FOR DeVelOPMenT	Yoshiko Matsumoto-Izadifar, OecD OcDe, acKnOW leDgeMenTs	2008
4286	Moreover, even after the adoption of the 1996 decentralisation law, devolving decision-making processes and financial resources to the rural entities is slow to meet the expectations of rural agricultural entrepreneurs.

4289	However, Kimhi and Nachlieli (2001) have shown that the natural process of structural change is often inhibited, as farmers choose to compensate low incomes with nonfarm incomes rather than leaving agriculture.	Senegalese rural households multiple livelihoods strategy: a potential solution for rural employment issues	Ya Cor NDIONE	2015
4290	Part-time farmers or pluriactive households are often perceived as groups that can potentially leave agriculture (Bryden and al, 1993; Tocco and al, 2010).	Senegalese rural households multiple livelihoods strategy: a potential solution for rural employment issues	Ya Cor NDIONE	2015
4291	The households rationally are supposed to participate in the nonfarm labour market when the nonfarm wage offered is higher than the reservation wage.	Senegalese rural households multiple livelihoods strategy: a potential solution for rural employment issues	Ya Cor NDIONE	2015
4292	The regression is made by considering a set of independent variables - as given in table 1 below - that are supposed to have an influence on the pluriactivity behavior of rural households.	Senegalese rural households multiple livelihoods strategy: a potential solution for rural employment issues	Ya Cor NDIONE	2015
4293	A household in which members practice at the same time agriculture, livestock, fishing, hunting or gathering is considered as agricultural and nonpluriactive.	Senegalese rural households multiple livelihoods strategy: a potential solution for rural employment issues	Ya Cor NDIONE	2015
4294	In the Niayes Region, an area where farming is possible throughout all the year, rural people still find it necessary to engage in non-farm rural activities.	Senegalese rural households multiple livelihoods strategy: a potential solution for rural employment issues	Ya Cor NDIONE	2015
4295	It was expected that when farm incomes are low, households develop multiple livelihoods strategies.	Senegalese rural households multiple livelihoods strategy: a potential solution for rural employment issues	Ya Cor NDIONE	2015
4296	Also, farm households that are doing well at harvest time prefer to go into non-agricultural activities instead of extending their farming activities.	Senegalese rural households multiple livelihoods strategy: a potential solution for rural employment issues	Ya Cor NDIONE	2015
4297	Given that the amount of available farm land is insufficient to allow the extension of agricultural activity, households prefer to turn to non-agricultural activities instead of investing in agriculture when their incomes rise.	Senegalese rural households multiple livelihoods strategy: a potential solution for rural employment issues	Ya Cor NDIONE	2015
4298	They may have land, but they prefer to use external workers in the fields.	Senegalese rural households multiple livelihoods strategy: a potential solution for rural employment issues	Ya Cor NDIONE	2015
4299	Women in this area prefer non-agricultural activities because agriculture requires rather difficult working conditions.	Senegalese rural households multiple livelihoods strategy: a potential solution for rural employment issues	Ya Cor NDIONE	2015
4300	It is important to note that in Senegalese rural areas, be it in rain-fed areas or in irrigated areas, rural populations do not intend to abandon agriculture, and therefore do not see pluriactivity as a stepping stone out of agriculture.	Senegalese rural households multiple livelihoods strategy: a potential solution for rural employment issues	Ya Cor NDIONE	2015
4301	Large households with high proportion of young people commonly find it necessary to diversify their income sources outside agriculture.	Senegalese rural households multiple livelihoods strategy: a potential solution for rural employment issues	Ya Cor NDIONE	2015
4302	EAS are increasingly viewed as a critical input into agricultural development and are thus strongly supported by the Comprehensive Africa Agricultural Development Program (CAADP), in its implementation strategy to accelerate African agricultural growth and transformation (African Union, 2014).

4303	As of 2014, 84 percent of Senegalese adults owned cell phones but only 15 percent owned smart phones.	Senegal: In-depth Assessment of Extension and Advisory Services		2018
4304	The program aims at self-sufficiency in rice by achieving a production of 1.6 million tons by 2017, a goal criticized by some as overambitious.	Senegal: In-depth Assessment of Extension and Advisory Services		2018
4305	Some farmer organizations use farmer trainers (called animateurs or relais in French), farmers who work as volunteers or are paid small allowances for assisting extension staff and training their fellow farmers.	Senegal: In-depth Assessment of Extension and Advisory Services		2018
4306	Thiare Farmers Union in Kaolack Region has 600 members and employs three farmer trainers.	Senegal: In-depth Assessment of Extension and Advisory Services		2018
4307	The farmer trainers are farmers whose technical backgrounds consist mainly of prior short-term training courses and training from ANCAR.	Senegal: In-depth Assessment of Extension and Advisory Services		2018
4308	About 800 women in Thies and Kaolack Regions supply hibiscus leaves to Bana-Bana for preparation of hibiscus juice, which is bottled and marketed across Senegal and exported to France as well.	Senegal: In-depth Assessment of Extension and Advisory Services		2018
4309	When farmers failed to supply sufficient grain to the company to cover the costs of the fertilizer that it had supplied to them, La Vivriere abandoned efforts to work with the farmers and stopped providing funds to ANCAR to provide advisory services to them.	Senegal: In-depth Assessment of Extension and Advisory Services		2018
4310	These committees are made up of researchers, extension services, POs and other stakeholders and are supposed to meet periodically.	Senegal: In-depth Assessment of Extension and Advisory Services		2018
4311	This is because many view extension services' mandate as simply to distribute inputs and partly because it is so easy to measure the quantity of inputs distributed relative to other more difficult measures, such as numbers of farmers adopting or area covered by a particular crop variety.	Senegal: In-depth Assessment of Extension and Advisory Services		2018
4312	Moreover, the objective of the farm management approach to extension, promoted by FONGS and SODEFITEX and described in the section on EAS methods, is to improve farmers' decision-making capacity to help them meet their goals and not just to promote input use.	Senegal: In-depth Assessment of Extension and Advisory Services		2018
4313	Ngaide and Chambaz (2007) reported that 10.9 percent of Senegal's extension staff working at the local level were female.	Senegal: In-depth Assessment of Extension and Advisory Services		2018
4314	Senegal has a strong tradition of farmer trainers, who tally about 9,100 (including community nutrition volunteers).	Senegal: In-depth Assessment of Extension and Advisory Services		2018
4315	As in many countries across Africa, agricultural extension is often viewed by policymakers and stakeholders in the agricultural sector as simply a means for improving the delivery of key production technologies to farmers.	Senegal: In-depth Assessment of Extension and Advisory Services		2018
4316	For example, Naatal Mbay often contracts with associations of POs and supports them in working with their member POs and farmers.	Senegal: In-depth Assessment of Extension and Advisory Services		2018
4317	Farmer-to-farmer extension is one of the most common extension approaches; farmer trainers are trained by extension staff and are responsible for assisting extension staff and training their fellow farmers, who are often members of the same farmer group as the farmer trainer.	Senegal: In-depth Assessment of Extension and Advisory Services		2018
4318	PADAER works with 527 farmer trainers and FONGS with 200.	Senegal: In-depth Assessment of Extension and Advisory Services		2018
4319	Naatal Mbay, and the partners through which it contracts, work with 4,199 farmer trainers who promote adoption of improved practices among members of their POs and neighboring POs.	Senegal: In-depth Assessment of Extension and Advisory Services		2018
4320	FONGS farmer trainers, in addition to training their fellow group members in improved agricultural practices, also pass messages between the organizations and farmers they work with, conduct monitoring exercises, and link farmers to other services, such as credit.	Senegal: In-depth Assessment of Extension and Advisory Services		2018
4321	Whereas the original intention was for farmer trainers to remain farmers and perform as farmer trainers as a civic duty, many of them are able to engage as farmer trainers for two or more organizations and thus become full-time farmer trainers.	Senegal: In-depth Assessment of Extension and Advisory Services		2018
4322	The consensus among stakeholders that we interviewed was that the farmer trainer approach is effective in helping extension staff reach more farmers and in promoting improved practices, However, stakeholders noted a number of problems: conflicts caused by different organizations offering farmer trainers different benefits or giving them conflicting advice, farmer trainers distancing themselves from farmers and conflicts between extension staff and farmer trainers.	Senegal: In-depth Assessment of Extension and Advisory Services		2018
4323	Demonstration plots are also considered by many extension services to be important means for exposing farmers to new practices.	Senegal: In-depth Assessment of Extension and Advisory Services		2018
4324	IRG (2015a) claimed that demonstration plots are particularly useful when managed by farmers rather than extension staff, because farmers respond better to claims of other farmers than to technical staff.	Senegal: In-depth Assessment of Extension and Advisory Services		2018
4325	Ndiaye, (2015) reported that according to a survey of 25 extension staffin the Senegal River Valley and Niayes in 2013, most extension staff have access to ICTs (72 percent had cell phones, 64 percent had email accounts, 48 percent had laptop computers and 40 percent had access to desktop computers).	Senegal: In-depth Assessment of Extension and Advisory Services		2018
4326	Another promising use of ICT is that of Naatal Mbay, which has pioneered the use of tablets and smart phones to help POs collect, analyze and use information for farmers to improve the productivity of their farms and to access services.	Senegal: In-depth Assessment of Extension and Advisory Services		2018
4327	Originally working with producer networks on basic digital data literacy, Naatal Mbay supported farmers to collect and analyze production data	Senegal: In-depth Assessment of Extension and Advisory Services		2018
4328	However, no regular programs target farmers to provide them with information about technologies and other innovations.	Senegal: In-depth Assessment of Extension and Advisory Services		2018
4329	Women in Kaffrine region identified community radio (using Wolof or another local language) as a preferred source for receiving agricultural information (Poulsen, 2015).	Senegal: In-depth Assessment of Extension and Advisory Services		2018
4330	The program was not expanded because farmers' lack of knowledge of the improved production practices the project was promoting (e.g., improved seed and fertilizers) was not considered as important a constraint to improving farm income as other constraints, such as access to inputs, credit, and markets.	Senegal: In-depth Assessment of Extension and Advisory Services		2018
4331	Whereas ANCAR agents often lack training and skills in marketing, Simpson (2012) reported that they play an important role in linking farmers in Kaolack Region to 25 of Senegal's largest cereal buyers, who are members of the Association of Processors of Local Millers (ATCL, for its French acronym).	Senegal: In-depth Assessment of Extension and Advisory Services		2018
4332	ATCL members reported being appreciative of the role that ANCAR agents play in ensuring that farmers provide grain of high quality and for providing local market information on which price premiums are based.	Senegal: In-depth Assessment of Extension and Advisory Services		2018
4333	Yet women appear to be underrepresented among EAS staff and farmer trainers.	Senegal: In-depth Assessment of Extension and Advisory Services		2018
4334	The proportion of farmer trainers who are women is not known, but data are available from Naatal Mbay for 2016/17 that show that it varies considerably by enterprise.	Senegal: In-depth Assessment of Extension and Advisory Services		2018
4335	For enterprises such as rainfed rice, in which women play an important role, 53 percent of farmer trainers are female.	Senegal: In-depth Assessment of Extension and Advisory Services		2018
4336	The overall proportion of women among all of Naatal Mbay farmer trainers is 22 percent.	Senegal: In-depth Assessment of Extension and Advisory Services		2018
4337	Development projects, such as Naatal Mbay, have contributed to their strengthening and, as a result, some EAS providers, like Naatal Mbay and FONGs, no longer need to work directly with farmers or even with POs, but can rather work through associations of POs instead.	Senegal: In-depth Assessment of Extension and Advisory Services		2018
4338	They were able to reach so many farmers because they contract with 123 other organizations, most of which are associations of POs, that cumulatively have 170,000 members.	Senegal: In-depth Assessment of Extension and Advisory Services		2018
4339	Several organizations stated that they rely on their farmer trainers to provide input into their organization's priorities in working with farmers and feedback on interventions.	Senegal: In-depth Assessment of Extension and Advisory Services		2018
4340	Ndiaye (2015) found that 80 percent of Senegalese extension staff interviewed felt that training in risk management was necessary for them yet such training is not available at universities or in in-service training.	Senegal: In-depth Assessment of Extension and Advisory Services		2018
4341	Related to the above, the links between ISRA and ANCAR are viewed by many stakeholders as being weak; there appeared to be little collaboration in identifying farmer problems, conducting research on solutions or evaluating results of dissemination efforts	Senegal: In-depth Assessment of Extension and Advisory Services		2018
4342	"We prefer a term that refers to what they do (farmer trainers or farmer promoters) rather than a term like ""lead farmers"" which refers to their status."	Senegal: In-depth Assessment of Extension and Advisory Services		2018
4343	Videos made with smart phones or small cameras are likely to be a cost-effective method for teaching farmers about new technologies such as these.	Senegal: In-depth Assessment of Extension and Advisory Services		2018
4344	The practices it is promoting include windbreaks, planting grafted fruit trees that mature more quickly than local varieties (baobab, tamarind, jujube (Ziziphus mauritiana or 'sii dem'), farmer managed natural tree regeneration and the production, processing and marketing of tree products such as baobab powder (Sanogo et al.	Senegal: In-depth Assessment of Extension and Advisory Services		2018
4345	NM should consider adopting measures that have helped extension providers in other countries to increase the proportion of female farmer trainers to 50 percent, including (1) providing gender training to those selecting farmer trainers, (2) targeting women's groups, (3) promoting couples to take on the position of farmer trainers instead of just the man, and (4) ensuring that work and training conditions are conducive to female participation.

4353	Senegal's perceived effectiveness of the anti-monopoly policy enforcement has declined over recent years from rank 70 in 2010/11 to rank 81 last year and now places Senegal on the 77th rank out of 137 economies.	None		2018
4354	Production is dominated by around 482,000 smallholder farmers, although some larger farms are also engaged in groundnut production.113 Senegal typically produces around 1 million tons of groundnuts a year.114 An estimated quarter of that production is used immediately on the farm for auto consumption, is recycled as seed or is lost in post-harvest handling.	None		2018
4355	The remainder of the groundnuts are either exported (roughly 35% in 2015/16)116 or go towards local artisanal products which are sold domestically, primarily as Seggal, a locally produced artisanal oil (25%).	None		2018

4373	Our analysis focuses on two regions in the West African Sahel, Bandiagara in Mali and Linguere in Senegal, that are presumed to be particularly affected by climate change and environmental degradation.	Vulnerability and the Role of Education in Environmentally Induced Migration in Mali and Senegal	Victoria van der Land, Diana Hummel	2013
4374	Education is considered one of several indicators (e.g., socioeconomic status, sex/gender, ethnicity, age, occupation, family structure) that affect people's social vulnerability (Cutter et al.	Vulnerability and the Role of Education in Environmentally Induced Migration in Mali and Senegal	Victoria van der Land, Diana Hummel	2013
4375	Second, subsistence and small-scale farming/livestock breeding are the main sources of income in both areas, which means that people are considered extremely vulnerable to environmental changes.	Vulnerability and the Role of Education in Environmentally Induced Migration in Mali and Senegal	Victoria van der Land, Diana Hummel	2013
4376	In this age group, 52% of the Senegalese survey participants have no formal education, compared to 70% in Mali.	Vulnerability and the Role of Education in Environmentally Induced Migration in Mali and Senegal	Victoria van der Land, Diana Hummel	2013
4377	Among the Senegalese survey participants, trading in commodities such as car tires or agricultural products is another important source of income (27%), whereas the Malian respondents are more likely to work as craftsmen or unskilled laborers (28%) such as watchmen or housemaids.	Vulnerability and the Role of Education in Environmentally Induced Migration in Mali and Senegal	Victoria van der Land, Diana Hummel	2013
4378	"Interviewees indicate that children were and still are expected to assist their families in agricultural and domestic work (girls only) instead of attending classes, as shown by the following statement by Aliou, a 34-yr-old man from the Senegalese study area: ""It's because of farming that we couldn't go to school."	Vulnerability and the Role of Education in Environmentally Induced Migration in Mali and Senegal	Victoria van der Land, Diana Hummel	2013
4379	Young people thus prefer to migrate to the cities to become involved in business and other income-generating activities.	Vulnerability and the Role of Education in Environmentally Induced Migration in Mali and Senegal	Victoria van der Land, Diana Hummel	2013
4380	People with a high level of education are often attracted by the cities due to better job opportunities.	Vulnerability and the Role of Education in Environmentally Induced Migration in Mali and Senegal	Victoria van der Land, Diana Hummel	2013
4381	"Most respondents with no formal education or only primary education (each 64%) give ""search for money/job opportunities"" as one of their main objectives for initial migration, whereas the more highly educated express far less agreement with this motive (17%)."	Vulnerability and the Role of Education in Environmentally Induced Migration in Mali and Senegal	Victoria van der Land, Diana Hummel	2013
4382	"The following statement by Abdou, a 60-yr-old man from Senegal, confirms migration as a common strategy to compensate for bad harvests: ""Every family is divided in two groups: one group stays in the village for farming (...) and one group migrates to the cities to work and support the family."	Vulnerability and the Role of Education in Environmentally Induced Migration in Mali and Senegal	Victoria van der Land, Diana Hummel	2013
4383	"However, some interviewees consider migration itself as ""a school of life,"" which is confirmed by the statement by Oumu, a 22-yrold woman in Mali: ""When I left the village, I got to know many people, I learned how to live, that's to say I gathered a lot of experience and was able to derive personal benefit from it."	Vulnerability and the Role of Education in Environmentally Induced Migration in Mali and Senegal	Victoria van der Land, Diana Hummel	2013
4384	Female participants generally tend to be educated to a lower level than men.	Vulnerability and the Role of Education in Environmentally Induced Migration in Mali and Senegal	Victoria van der Land, Diana Hummel	2013
4385	Most families in our study regions depend on agricultural activities as their main source of income and are thus presumed to be vulnerable to environmental change and high climate variability.	Vulnerability and the Role of Education in Environmentally Induced Migration in Mali and Senegal	Victoria van der Land, Diana Hummel	2013
4386	Quantitative and qualitative results show that many youths do not seem to see their future in agriculture, which is highly dependent on unpredictable, highly variable, or scarce rainfall and decreasing soil fertility.	Vulnerability and the Role of Education in Environmentally Induced Migration in Mali and Senegal	Victoria van der Land, Diana Hummel	2013
4387	Families relying on agriculture as a main source of income often prefer their children to support them in farming or in domestic work, instead of attending classes.	Vulnerability and the Role of Education in Environmentally Induced Migration in Mali and Senegal	Victoria van der Land, Diana Hummel	2013
4388	However, the survey results illustrate that the well-educated respondents tend to be in a better position to increase the money transfers from migration to their families than are people with no formal education or primary education.	Vulnerability and the Role of Education in Environmentally Induced Migration in Mali and Senegal	Victoria van der Land, Diana Hummel	2013
4389	Moreover, many migrants consider migration itself as an education that opens up possibilities of discovering and learning new things.	Vulnerability and the Role of Education in Environmentally Induced Migration in Mali and Senegal	Victoria van der Land, Diana Hummel	2013
4390	These regions are presumed to be affected negatively by climate change and by environmental changes such as land degradation, which place pressure on the majority of inhabitants, who mainly have a low level of education and rely heavily on agriculture to sustain their livelihoods.

4393	The government wanted to continue to hold and control the assets, however, and was therefore not interested in either full divestiture or a long-term concession.	Innovative Contracts, Sound Relationships: Urban Water Sector Reform in Senegal	Clarissa Brocklehurst, Jan G. Janssens	2004
4394	"This was due in part to the fact that there was intense political pressure to preserve the ""patrimoine"" (heritage) of the country in public hands and maintain government autonomy, and also because there was some concern that because private sector participation was new to Senegal, the government should select a form of contract that would allow for learning and adjustment."	Innovative Contracts, Sound Relationships: Urban Water Sector Reform in Senegal	Clarissa Brocklehurst, Jan G. Janssens	2004
4395	"This created a more robust and ""irreversible"" situation, and also sent a message that there was political commitment to reform at the highest levels.29 The donors involved were very supportive of this decision."

4798	For a humble village enterprise that has pretty much cornered the capital city's fresh oyster market, seeing this end is very satisfying: these men know the journey of the oysters all the way from the strings they sway on in the mangrove tide, through the hands of woolen-gloved women in a wet pirogue, down the bumpy sand road, across the ferry at Foundiougne, and through the funneled Dakar traffic all the way to this westernmost point of the continent.
