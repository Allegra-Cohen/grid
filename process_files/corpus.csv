sentence
"Pape is a colleague at Manobi, an agCelerant manager."
Very important crop in Senegal; rice is the principal component of the dishes.
"Price and availability is very important, especially in rural areas."
"If availability decreases, so does people's ability to eat every day."
The cultivars are the same for household and cash crop.
"Two types of rice, imported and local, but imported is much more widely consumed."
"In the SRV, there's an institution called SAED which has organized in which areas the farmers should cultivate and how they should do so."
They are using tractors to limit the ways water should pass from river to cultivation areas.
The farmers are monitored by SAED.
The rest of the information comes either from the bank directly or between farmers.
"Banks get information from SAED, who knows how much rice has been cultivated in each season."
"SAED also informs suppliers (seeds, fertilizer) of the quantity needed by farmers in which areas."
Banque Agricole has a fixed loan rate every season (7.5%)!
"Microfinance institutions   there are three on the list of interviews   also finance the farmers, the rates are usually around 13%."
"Farmers prefer the lower rates, but sometimes they don't have the chance to get these loans because you have to convince SAED or have some sort of connection with SAED to get loans."
"Farmers connect to SAED through the heads of their cooperatives, or if the farmer has a large area of cultivation he can directly contact SAED and say,  I have a large area, I want you to connect me to Banque Agricole."
"If they want to give some money to SAED to make that link, they can."
Starting ticket at Banque Agricole is 5 hectares.
"This is around 10 minutes in, I missed something important about why someone wouldn't go through Banque Agricole."
5 hectares allows you to create a cooperative or village organization and ask for a loan.
"Pape considers a  smallholder  to be 0.25 - 1 ha, but for rice cultivation it starts around 10 ha."
"There's a lot of space and cultivating 10 ha costs around $6000, which  isn't that expensive."
"This land is rented, or it's a family where each member of the family has some hectares and puts them together into cooperatives."
Farmers rent from other farmers or cooperatives who have so much space they can't cultivate it.
Farmers who have < 5 ha probably only grow rice for consumption.
"If you have 5 tons per hectare and you have 2 - 5 hectares, you can't eat that much yourself."
"The most important information to decide which season to start   
Two seasons, the space of action is quite large between 15 Jan to 15 March."
Weather is not that important to them.
Most important information is whether they can get financing.
"Farmers usually follow the prescribed ranges from SAED for planting, etc., various actions."
"Before the end of the prescribed planting range, they see if they can get a tractor to prepare the land."
"Then they say to the service provider, I'll do the season if you can prepare the land for me; if I have a loan then I can pay you back."
"If they don't have a loan before the end of the prescribed range, they won't go for it."
} This is for the dry season.
For the rainy season credit is not as much of a problem; tractors can't work in the rain.
There's usually a break of 2  - 5 days in which farmers can decide whether to prepare if they have the loan.
"If the dry season was good, they proceed on their own funds and kickstart the process ahead of loans."
Farmers just need 1 week between receipt of credit and planting.
"Supplies are very easily accessed for everybody, local organizations usually have stocks of seeds and fertilizers."
"From time to time there are subsidies for each cropping season; the amount of supplies needed is prepared for each season, and shortages are rarely happening in northern Senegal."
The inputs are well-known and prescribed by SAED.
"There might be differences between cropping seasons in phyto-  chemicals, because weeds will change from year to year   but sometimes the right chemicals are in short supply because they can't buy enough products for each type of weed."
So they don't know what type of problem will crop up so they can't buy the right chemicals.
"Sometimes banks give out loans very late, and then the farmers want to stay on track for the season so they will want to use a cultivar that is different than normal   but again, if the suppliers don't know this ahead of time, then there will be a seed shortage of the type of cultivar desired."
SAED does a technical review of the previous season using agents throughout villages and heads of cooperatives.
SAED uses the same technique to generate information each year.
"If there was a particularly bad year (pests, etc.)"
they try to fix the problems but the information is fairly consistent from year to year.
"SAED's information is important for the seasons to go well, but it doesn't have the elasticity to adapt when there's something that comes up during the cropping season."
No system of in-season adaptation.
"The knowledge that the cooperatives have is based on what they're told the cropping season should look like (e.g. sowing occurs 15 days after land preparation, 2 days after that they apply fertilizer,  )."
"It's very fixed information for a changing climate, and the farmer knows this, but he can't transfer that knowledge to SAED because he doesn't actually know if it's important   that is, you can't tell if something weird is consequential until you see if the harvest is bad or not."
SAED doesn't respond well to monitoring information and farmers don't know if unusual or non-standard occurrences are important to SAED.
SAED delivers information to each cooperative head through field agents.
Cooperative heads disseminate information to farmers.
"No platform for information-sharing   if a farmer isn't part of a cooperative, they might never get that information."
"Farmers do trust the information from SAED ( yes, absolutely )   it's in the interest of SAED to give the right information to farmers."
Farmers usually say the information is lacking when asked how they value SAED information.
SAED doesn't often come to see the farmers because there aren't enough field agents.
Farmers feel isolated from information agents.
"Two methods of improving information systems:
1."
"Even if the farmer is at home and doesn't belong to a cooperative, he should still get weekly visits from field agents."
2
Digital SMS platform to transfer information
"Farmers are quite connected, they usually have smartphones with WhatsApp."
"The fear will be that since so many people are connected, the information will be diluted   that it doesn't seem to be important if there's too much information that's easily accessed."
"Pape thinks the best solution is weekly rounds with coop heads from field agents, with a two-way street of information rather than just SAED-to-farmer."
Second most important actors besides SAED and the banks are the buyers.
They can also give loans!!
"If a loan only covers part of a farmer's land, the buyers will give loans to cover the rest."
Interest rates vary from 15 - 20%.
"If farmers can't pay back a loan, they do a kind of mortgage that they pay off through the next season."
People do get caught in loan traps.
Some farmers jump from coop to coop to avoid this situation.
Banks usually don't ask for collateral   for Banque Agricole
"it's not that important, because the coop guarantees payback."
Buyers have field agents (!!!)
who know about each area and what loans exist and how much rice needs buying.
"At the end of the season, the field agent comes to ask for the payback."
There are sometimes formal contracts but not always.
"The field agents try to come first because farmers have a lot of loans, and the person who comes first is prioritized/more likely to actually be repaid."
Buyers usually don't provide information to farmers or ask for any information about monitoring.
"Buyers will ask if a farmer has access to a harvester, to ensure they can get help harvesting their land."
NGOs usually work with the banks or with SAED.
"Pape has never seen them working directly with cooperatives, except in the cases where the coops are doing more than production (e.g. processing and commerce)."
"NGOs aren't directly involved in production, only in processing and commercialization."
Never seen an example where NGOs provides inputs or tractors.
"Other middlemen   manufacturers of seeds and fertilizers, but nobody else other than service providers doing transportation"
Pape's perspective is that the system is quite well organized and very closed.
"If you want to enter and provide services you have to talk to SAED and banks, you can't just work with farmers."
"If farmers talk to someone who isn't from SAED, farmers will think it's a scam."
"Pape thinks the system works well in this closed fashion, but the farmers should have more liberty to work with private service providers."
Farmers have capacity to know what's good for them and to ask for it.
Allowing more freedoms for farmers would help the system grow.
"If farmers can have new seeds and services, it would reduce costs and increase growth."
Farmers' information about a season can have a lot of consequences.
"When they don't have money to start a season, they don't   this is different than when they used to start the season before they have credit and just keep going if they didn't get it."
Farmers will do horticulture for subsistence but not rice planting without a loan.
There's too much uncertainty to embark on a season without funding.
Disasters are too unpredictable in when they occur throughout the season.
"3 more experts to speak to:
Banque Agricole or microfinances (the latter have more problems than Banque Agricole)"
1
The birds will do a lot of damage to the rice.
"If a farmer waits until the rice is ready, he might lose more than if he harvests early."
Dr. Fall expects him to harvest early.
2
"If labor is available, and the harvesters are not available, a farmer will harvest early if he expects a good market price or if birds are nearby or if he wants to spend less on harvest."
"If a farmer's farm size is big enough, he will wait until harvesters are available, but if his plots are small, he will hire labor."

Mr. D grew tomatoes in last year's cold/dry season and made a good profit.
"But this year, the price of paddy is higher, rice seed is subsidized and the government is pressuring farmers to grow rice."
We must notice that rice and tomatoes are not grown at the same time.
A farmer might do rice and then as a result he might miss the cropping season for tomatoes.
"If you have one farm, two crops in the same year may conflict on the calendar."
"If a farmer harvests paddy rice late, he won't be able to start tomatoes in the cold/dry season."
"If a farmer had a good price for tomatoes last season, no matter what the government says about rice, he will grow tomatoes again because he's thinking about the profits, even though the rice is subsidized."
"If the expected profit for tomatoes is higher, it doesn't matter what the government does to incentivize rice."
A half hectare of tomatoes earns almost twice as much for the farmer than one hectare of rice.
But the inputs for tomatoes are higher.
4
The lateness of credit last season does matter for this season's decision.
You might decide to plant different crops if your credit was late last year.
"Farmers are afraid of risk, so they change tactics if their crop choice went badly last year and they have access to alternatives."
"Farmers also may fall back on remittances, parental help, sale of livestock and off-farm income."
5
"Last year, tomatoes sold at a high price and many of Mr. D's neighbors have already planted tomatoes this year."
Mr. D is later than his neighbors and the price of seed is going up.
The price does influence the crop choice decision.
"If the price of seed is going up, you might choose to crop something else."
"Tomatoes is one of the crops with access to credit, so if you can get credit, you might go for tomatoes."
"Some farmers decide to do the opposite than what the majority is doing, banking on the benefit of being in the minority."
Deciding to go against the majority tends to be a personality trait of the farmer.
"If you do what everybody does, you face the same problems as everybody faces; if you do the opposite, you're alone with your crop."
Farmers will compare the expected profit of tomatoes to the increasing price of seed to determine whether that seed price is too high.
"Dr. Fall would expect the majority of farmers would go for tomatoes, because the price of tomato seed probably wouldn't be so much compared to the expected profit."
"Last year was a good year for tomatoes, so farmers expect the same thing this year, and the price of seed just can't get high enough to cut into the profits."
Dr. Fall expects 50 to 60% of farmers to go for tomatoes.
The leading factor in crop choice is last year's profit.

Mr. A has a small farm (0.75 ha) in Podor.
"In the past, he bought certified seed and fertilizer and sold most of his rice to a local miller."
"But this year, the price of fertilizer is much higher because of the war in Ukraine."
"One part of produced rice is for home consumption, but two thirds of it is for sale and repayment."
"Even if fertilizer prices skyrocket, a farmer doesn't have other options than to grow rice for sale, because he needs cash to fund his household, not just a supply of subsistence rice; he wouldn't grow lower quality rice, he would simply try to get a higher paddy price."
"No matter how high the fertilizer price, a farmer will purchase inputs to grow and sell rice, because otherwise he doesn't have money to buy the things he needs that aren't rice."
"In the Senegal River Valley, almost all farmers try to sell some of their crop."
"In the rainfed areas of Senegal, farmers grow almost everything for subsistence and don't worry about inputs or quality."
"The proportion of rice kept for consumption depends on the size of the farm and the size of production; if you are a big farm, you tend to sell more rice."
"A big farm might sell 50 to 60%, a small farm might sell a third."
7
"Suppose that Mr. A has harvested, but he hasn't repaid his coop yet."
He is aware that the war in Ukraine might make food prices skyrocket.
A tricky question because people aren't used to these types of events.
The price of rice right now is very high and people are complaining about all food prices.
Dr. Fall expects farmers to think about how to hold more rice back for home consumption than in the past.
"Farmers know that they are facing high prices for all foods, so they will try to keep more rice for themselves."
"Dr. Fall expects the price of paddy to be high this year too, partly because farmers will be selling less."
"Farmers might emphasize tomatoes this cold/dry season, expecting a high price, in order to get enough cash to afford other foods at their high prices."
Sometimes people sell tomatoes to pay back credit for rice.
"Sometimes farmers just do one crop a year because they harvest late, etc."
Dr. Fall expects farmers to double crop this year:
"Growing tomatoes in the cold/dry season and paddy in the rainy season, keeping more paddy for consumption, in order to have a surplus of both cash and rice."
"Everybody is aware of the high prices at the market, also because everything is on the radio."
"The government is relying on farmers to be able to reduce the amount of imported food, and is making equipment and technology available to try and increase production."
"Dr. Fall expects that the Valley will have a really good year in rice because the Ministry of Agriculture is preparing a program to increase farmer access, in order to reduce imports."
"Farmers are growing more tomatoes and rice for their own benefit and to prevent their own hunger, but also because they're interested in the national big picture."
"Farmers are aware that people are afraid of famine, so they are interested in helping prevent that."
"Farmers are invested in helping fellow citizens, which is encouraged by radio spots saying that farmers are integral to the national strategy to avoid famine."
"The government is making it easier for farmers to double crop by subsidizing inputs, etc., through new programs in response to the war."
"Dr. Fall thinks the biggest risk to this farmer mobilization is rainfall in the rainfed regions, but in the irrigated regions, the mechanisms of production and milling are tight enough that the risk of increasing production is quite low."
"If you go to the rainfed zone, the government is trying to subsidize millet, sorghum and maize in addition to rice, and Dr. Fall expects that the area of production will increase as well."
This year the rains are predicted to be good.

Suppose Ms. N goes to the market in her city and the price of her preferred imported rice brand is very high.
"An urban consumer is likely to switch to local rice if imported price is too expensive, but she might not find local rice available in the market."
"The problem isn't that urban consumers don't like local rice (in fact, they do like it), but sometimes they can't find any."
"If a consumer sees any other rice alternative to her favorite rice brand, she will go for it; the second choice is millet, sorghum and maize."
"Millet, sorghum and maize tend to be dinner foods in urban zones; in the rural zone, millet is used anywhere, anytime."
Urban consumers don't like millet and sorghum as much as rice because they take too much time to cook and urban consumers are always short on time.
"Now rural women are migrating to cities to process millet and sorghum, and the resulting semi-processed grains are faster to cook."
"Usually you have to pound millet into farina in one step and make it into a type of couscous in a second step before you cook it, but now that women from rural zones are taking over the pounding, urban women can buy the partially processed results and then finish the processing at home."
"In the rural zones, the work of converting millet to couscous is a daily chore and people know how to do it quickly and consider it as part of their work; in the urban zones, people prefer to buy semi-finished products."
9
Ms. N has heard about the war in Ukraine and its predicted effect on food prices.
Dr. Fall doesn't expect people to hoard rice; people just want to live day-to-day.
"Women usually go to the market at the end of the month to buy a barrel of oil, a couple bags of rice, a couple bags of sugar, and so on, but this isn't hoarding behavior."
"In terms of money, people would save through hoarding, but it's just not common for consumers to do that in Senegal."
Traders may hoard stores of rice.
A union of traders and importers have recently pooled their resources in a financial holding to hire transportation and buy as much rice as they can to protect themselves in the future.
"Dr. Fall hasn't heard any arguments from the government against the union of traders and importers, but he just read about this in the paper today."
"But he thinks the government won't worry, because if the government fixes the price, then traders and importers have to sell at that price, even if they have stores of rice."
"Dr. Fall thinks the union of traders and importers could be a type of speculation or monopoly, buying up all the rice, in which case it would be bad; but if it is a matter of being ready to supply their country with rice and protecting their fellow countrymen, then it's not bad."
"He says these types of unions always say they are acting patriotically, but he thinks it's all about increasing price by restricting supply."
10
City locals have seen rice price increase in their markets.
Dr. Fall thinks people would say that the government should reduce the price of food.
Every person on the radio is saying that the government should intervene to reduce the price.
People would also say that the government should continue to keep the price of oil and gas fixed and to subsidize agriculture (again to reduce the price of food).
"Most people are skeptical that the government will reduce food prices, but the government just doesn't have enough resources to subsidize oil, subsidize agriculture, pay its employees, import food, and reduce prices all at once."
11
Suppose rice imports are predicted to be insufficient to meet national demand.
12
"Dr. Fall doubts that consumers really know the role of the government; they think that the government has the power to do anything, including controlling import prices, but Senegal is a price-taker."
"The majority of Senegalese believe that the government can control the price of imports, but that isn't the case at all."
The government is trying to communicate to its citizens that it can't control import prices and subsidize everything.
"As Senegal enters election season, the opposition is lying about being able to fix prices if they get elected."
13
An elderly couple own a small subsistence farm.
"Their children are in the city and can't get home, either because of Covid restrictions or transportation costs."
"The local cooperative wouldn't help an elderly couple without children to harvest their fields, because cooperatives have their own goals."
"But farmers in town will intervene socially, independently of the cooperative business, in order to help an elderly couple in need of labor; either because they are related to the couple, or they're socially prominent, or some other reason."
It is culturally expected to help elders and to go harvest their fields and give them the product.
"People won't think you're a bad person if you don't help out when a community member needs help, but you might then not get help in your time of need because people will remember that you didn't pitch in."
14
The government is planning a new irrigation scheme and accepting applications to farm the land there.
They are prioritizing women farmers.
Mr. D is [an experienced smallholder / a large landowner / a young farmer].
Men are very selfish.
"If the government prioritizes female farmers, male farmers must wait to get land because it's a government mandate, but they probably don't agree with the decision."
"Male farmers might not understand why their wives should be prioritized while they don't get anything, because they expect to be part of irrigated schemes."
"Some ethnic groups are very, very conservative, so gender lines are even sharper and male farmers expect to be deities of the household."
15
There are different religious groups: Fanatic groups that focus on the religious leaders will try to have some alternative plans to keep the holidays going.
"Sheep Day is approaching, so more moderate religious families are probably worried about the price of livestock, but they will do the holiday anyways as best as they can."
"In general, people have to do their religious holidays, but they will tighten their belts."
"People are not  more  or  less  religious, everybody does their practices that allow them to think about right and wrong, etc., but in a logical way."
"Holidays are methods of practicing religions   whether you kill a sheep or a chicken, you're still practicing religion."
"Like in COVID-19, people couldn't go to the mosque, but they still prayed at home."
"The fanatics are much more extreme, less logical!"
"Easier to go through extension agencies, easier door to get in through."
"You can have your own program, but you need to collaborate with people who farmers know."
You need introductions!
SRV is an elaborate network of people who know each other.
You have to get together to have discussions and talk about rice.
"Rice is the most administrative crop   everyone wants to come to work on it, you go through the same partners, so everyone knows each other and everyone knows about the programs that are going on."
"Dr. Fall wouldn't say it's hundreds of people involved, but definitely many."
"There's research, training, extension, financial organizations, coops, statistics department, NGO programs, DJIKA programs, USAID programs"
The networks are much stronger in the Delta area.
"When you go above Podor, it's a little far away people coming from Dakar just don't want to go there!"
"In reality, they're not benefitting from the same services as in the Delta."
They're not given the same opportunities.
"They're also not used to it, because you have to get used to it   to have the time to talk to people, etc."
They are trying but it's not the same as in the Delta zone.
Government is thinking about it constantly.
They want to provide more irrigation systems to the Podor/Matam zones.
They're trying to subsidize Matam more than Delta.
"But the powerful, educated farmer organizations are based in Delta, so they have ways of keeping resources in the Delta!"
"The government knows this and is trying to solve it, but continuously facing lobbying from Delta."
Farmers in Matam and Bakel are fighting to get the attention of new programs and to lead new organizations.
"Delta farmers say they're leaders  of the SRV    but in reality, they're leaders of the Delta zone."
Matam and Bakel farmers try to head new programs because they're less represented otherwise.
Delta farmers just had a head start in terms of experience because that's where the irrigation schemes started.
Not yet.
Only started two or three years ago.
"Need to have a phone to use, hasn't been established yet."
Being used by extension agents from SAED but no one else.
That was instituted around 1998.
Big agribusinesses with ~4000 hectares and the big millers would be interested in crop modeling to modernize their farms.
Private rice growers want information.
Most of the time people want to plant the same variety if they're in a coop.
"But the big farms, they'll pick one or two varieties."
"Dr. Fall says they should be more precise in terms of what the market requests   they better know at what time whole grain rice will come and where, so they can compete."
"If you're a precise, good, professional rice producer, you need information to have good position in the market."
"Not only is the current production not enough, you're also constantly competing against the import market."
You also have to promote your local rice!
You need to know what consumers prefer for which dishes and what varieties they want for milled rice   whole grain or broken.
"Need information about imports, how millers handle rice, local demand   market environment, miller environment, consumer environment."
In Senegal they have religious events where people consume a LOT of rice.
You've got a million people coming to a town in a pilgrimage and you have to feed them all rice!
Review: Demand for new projects in Matam and Bakel; value for new technology; trying to get any new technology into the Valley requires going through the networks.
Oh yeah!
Sometimes they make some decisions which may not be linear.
"Cultivating one crop or another, or using a lot of fertilizer instead of what is required   usually 100 kg/ha but sometimes people use 140 or 150."
"But he says that sometimes farmers know best themselves, and the closer to farmers are to extension agencies the better practices they have."
Credit depends on the number of hectares under cultivation.
Farmers know what land they have as a coop   individual farms are just plots within a big box.
Credit is dispersed according to number of hectares.
"For X amount of land, a farmer needs X amount of fertilizer, X amount of seed, etc."
"The credit is not cash credit, it's on bonds   so you go to the service providers (seed or fertilizer operators) and give the bonds to them; then the service providers go to the bank to be paid."
"You can pick the provider, and they get a certificate from the farmer stating they provided the input."
The credit comes exclusively from Banque Agricole which is private/public-owned; established by the state to lower interest rates and help farmers.
"But now there's another financial system of commercial banks with higher rates of interest, and microfinance which is lower than commercial bank but higher than Banque Agricole."
Coops go to banks outside the Banque Agricole if they're being punished after defaulting with BA (loss of credit for all farmers moving forward).
"They'll even go to the miller, who finance inputs in exchange for some paddy afterwards."
"Dr. Fall says it's pretty common for someone to default, but usually the coops use the land-for-credit trick so the coop as a whole doesn't default."
"The formal system is slow, but it's still quicker than the informal system!!"
"Also the informal system might not give you the seeds you want, they might not be high quality seeds, they might be even later because the financiers themselves have to get financed from somewhere else Credit union at least guarantees the provision of certified seed, because that's a requirement of getting credit."
"[Note: I think just because you have to use certified seed doesn't mean that it will be provided, this part was unclear]."
"Loan issues induce conflict within cooperatives, and sometimes they all decide to go their own way."
"If you don't pay back, there's conflict within the community."
"At harvest time, the cooperative has to collect ALL the yield from farmers and store in headquarters; then they take all the corresponding credit from each farmer's production and leave the remaining to each farmer."
"e.g. you might keep two bags, but you must pay back credit first."
Discussion of central bank regulations that I didn't really understand!
"Financing line in any bank they choose, to support startup costs and subsidize through credit for farmers, e.g. for new equipment, etc."
", French (AFD)."
Some are powerful enough to influence farm behavior.
"For example, the USAID project was working with millers who were having difficulty accessing paddy, so they established a program with farmers, millers and traders."
"Farmers get credit from credit union, millers get access to paddy and credit from USAID, millers sell through traders and then pay back the credit union for farmers."
Decision-making conformed to the rules because farmers want the profit.
Amount of credit for input is pretty small.
"For improving the system itself, farmers need to be pushed to get access to equipment."
"Credit union makes a program to subsidize 20 or 30% of equipment cost, so farmers pay back only ~70% of 40 million or whatever."
Afrique is an institution that does longer-term loans supported by the state.
It depends on the AEZ.
"If you're in the Delta zone where there's a lot of influences from the NGOs and the extension agencies and more educated farmers, where farmers organize themselves professionally and influence policy; if the coop is strong and the leaders are good and there's enough aggregated land then you're probably going to get credit."
"In the past they failed to recoup loans in the Delta, but now that the Delta farmers know how important credit is and because they recognize the potential punishment during default, it doesn't happen so much."
3 PRD was a French project aiming to build irrigation for rice.
"If you have up to 20 ha, they call you a small private enterprise."
20 - 100 they call intermediate.
200
#NAME?
"Covering 80% of the costs as intermediate, 90% as high category, 40% for small enterprise."
There's a lot of attrition in these kinds of programs.
"If there's a big disaster or bad year, the government erases credit debt (especially near elections!!!)"
Some farmers take advantage of this.
"If farmers are organized, prepared to plant, have good records, etc."
then they probably have credit.
But you might see farms where everyone is working individually and they're struggling to get fertilizer and you know they don't have credit.
Can also look at the density of service providers.
Or the presence of big leaders.
Or if you have the right type of land   but for irrigated system most people's land is suitable.
But for tomatoes you need the right type of soil.
How far is your plot from the principle source of water.
"Everyone has their own day for water distribution; if you're far away, then you might be late getting access, which might determine the crops you grow."
"Coop leaders don't really direct what the area is, but they might influence what to crop, how to switch from one crop to another; they have information about fertilizer, etc..  Oh, the leader is growing onion, so maybe I will follow."
"Coop leaders participate in the inter-profession organizations (farmers, millers, traders, bankers) who trade information and pressure the government."
"Farmers in these organizations can basically go on strike over things like land tenure   they can be like,  We're going to stop the season in its tracks if you want to give our land to agribusinesses."
"Top 5 things to make a decision as a farmer about what crop you're gonna grow and why:
1."
2
"If they sold the appropriate way and lost money, they're going to shift to another crop
3."
4
"Need to know the costs of the different inputs   depending on the costs of production, especially in the beginning of the cropping season, because you need to get the inputs before you start cropping."
"Need enough money just for the very first input needs, e.g. land preparation, water access, and seed."
5
Labor   most of the irrigated system requires a lot of labor if you're not using machinery (and you probably aren't because it's expensive.)
Sometimes your family isn't enough labor so you have to hire labor.
"You might not have enough money to hire labor, COVID might make it difficult, or nobody can move the machinery to where you are."
Often there's temporary migration into the SRV but not during the pandemic.
Sugar cane production happens at the same time so there's competition.
National agency that aims to regulate the producers by fixing dates to limit imports.
This is so producers can sell before imports come in.
This is mainly for onions and for some other vegetables.
"But for tomatoes, there's an industry working with farmers to buy local production, and even though it's not always capable of buying all the production, there's still a good market."
"But for onions, the farmers being in cooperatives, they lobby to pressure the government for a grace period after harvest where imports are stopped, e.g. a month in which domestic producers can sell before imports are allowed."
"This agency is under the ministry of trade, with cooperation from the ministry of agriculture."
This agency is all for horticulture crops.
No similar agency for rice because rice is open market.
"There's some effort for promotion of local rice, and sometimes they increase the tax rate of importers for rice, but the mechanism is quite different than the onion import market."
have to buy a proportion of local rice before they're allowed to buy international rice.
"But this isn't the case anymore because they don't produce enough for domestic consumers, and also urban consumers are shifting towards local rice."
"Senegal has two different markets: whole grain (locally grown) and broken rice (most important, coming from Asia.)"
Onion Growers' Cooperative is nation-wide so they have the power to pressure the government.
"Most of them are in the SRV because most production is in Podor, but there's also the Niaye zone that's the main horticulture zone that has onion too (Dakar to St. Louis)."
"From the farmer POV, the best cultivar is the one with high yields."
But that's not the only factor; you might have high yields but not good pest resistance.
But farmers focus on the good yields because that's the way they can increase production volume and thus income.
"Rice doesn't sell based on cultivar, it's fixed over all varieties, so the more the better."
"However, they also consider the length of the cycle:"
"Farmers choose short cycle if they crop late, because then they can make up time."
Another factor is resistance to weeds or birds   but resistance to birds is about the length of the grain and whether it's protected (though there's no such thing as a really bird resistant cultivar.)
"Yield, cycle, quality in terms of soil and weed resistance, and birds."
But people prefer mostly Sahel-108 because of the market.
"If you have good yields but it's not suitable to the consumers' dish to prepare, you might have an issue selling."
"It's difficult for consumers to tell whether rice is aromatic or not, unless there's a label to interest the consumer."
Some people prefer aromatic rice.
Cultivar choice varies between zones.
It's based on market orientation.
"If you're close to the big cities like St Louis and Dakar, you have to pay attention more to the consumer preference than those who are far away and sell locally."
"In Podor towards the Upper Upper Upper Valley, it's the urban-producing area because there do exist cities, but they're making local rice."
"But once you're towards St. Louis, you're producing for the urban consumer market."
Cooperatives try to have information about consumer preferences which they get from SAED research and also researchers coming to promote their own cultivars.
"Much of it is word of mouth through research workshops, etc."
Extension agents are the formal mechanism for informing farmers about cultivars and consumer preferences.
That's another constraint.
Seed producers want to produce the cultivars that are interesting to farmers.
"They may guess through what they think people want to do, but if farmers want to plant something else, they may not find the seed."
That way they can make a better guess.
"The seed operators are highly concentrated in the Delta zone, so those farmers may determine the variety portfolio."
That's a very hard game.
They did a lot of research but ended up deciding themselves what they thought would happen based on what's happened before.
"Based on demand during these last three years, a quarter of production will be Sahel-108."
There's no formal demand process.
Farmers always show up late to ask for specific types of seed!
"Operators usually don't tailor for zones, they usually produce for Delta."
"If you go somewhere with small operators, you might get a limited and non-diverse supply."
In Delta there's more diversity because the operators are bigger and more numerous.
"Some farmers used to save seed ( market seed    not improved seed) but since they now get loans from the credit bank, the bank requires that farmers use improved seeds."
In the rainfed zone farmers still save seed.
Farmers that go without credit use their own seeds or buy from the market (not improved).
Few of them do that because the majority have access to credit.
"He guesses, based on the factors he's listed and the market tendency."
"Sometimes if there's high demand for a type of cultivar and there's not enough, then you have to dip into the remaining stock from last year."
"(Note, this was a good summary at about 36 minutes in for the modelers, but I zoned out a little, sorry!)"
"~ Diagram time ~

During harvest, there's a few factors to consider."
"For the majority, you have to ask if you have equipment ready to harvest."
This choice depends on different factors:
"Are you willing to harvest very rapidly because you're having bird attacks or other damages that speed up your timeline; is it wet or dry, because the humidity of the paddy means some might be lost by machinery; and labor is cheaper than equipment."
Another factor is availability of service providers   sometimes there's a lot of demand around the zone   and they're more available in the Delta zone.
the birds.
"A final factor is that you need to repay your loans before you can get new credit, so you want to harvest faster so you can repay faster."
"For labor, you pay 1/10th of your production for a harvester."
"If you use a thresher on top of that, that costs 18%."
"There's a debate: Because most plots are small (0.5 ha), people say taking labor is the best way of having high yield production."
"If you use a thresher with tiny plots, sometimes you lose more yield than if you were using labor."
"But others say threshers produce clean, fast, high quality paddy without a bunch of weeds, and labor takes time"
"and it's sandy, weedy paddy."
It's a debate between scientists and technicians.
"Dr. Fall believes that if you have a small plot, it's best to use manual labor if you harvest on time."
"If you have a big plot, there's no way you can harvest it all on time by labor!"
"Unfortunately, everybody wants to harvest at the last moment, and then there's no service providers available."
Another factor is that labor gets more expensive when there's crops being harvested for export markets that compete.
In the past people use animal traction.
"In Podor, the type of soil is appropriate for that."
Nowadays that's diminishing.
"You either use the big machine or the small one, depending on their prices and availabilities and the size of your plot."
Sometimes people just like to use the big machines no matter the size of their plots!
But the research is always advising that small plots use small machines.
"Plot size varies between zones, though not much."
"More or less it's between 0.5 ha and 3 or 4 in the Delta zone, but as you go along the Upper Delta the irrigated scheme diminishes and the sizes get smaller (0.5 - 1.5)."
"But in Delta you might find a farmer with 10 or even 20 ha, though there are very few."
Average size is 0.5 to 1.5 in Delta.
"For labor, farmers are always using family labor."
"But for seeding and harvesting, it mostly comes from hired labor."
"Hired labor mostly comes from the rainfed zone, which is why there was no hired labor during COVID-19."
There's different labor demands in the SRV:
"Tomato industry, rice industry, millers, export horticulture."
"There's seeding periods, harvest periods, where labor is needed in various industries and there's a competition."
"There are other times of the year, like rice season, where there's only rice."
"But during harvest time for rice, harvest for rice corresponds to seeding period for horticulture croppings."
"So if those farms need labor for horticulture, they may compete with farms that need harvest labor."
"On top of this, when the rainy season comes, some laborers have to return to rainfed zone so they can plant their own crops!"
This is why there's less labor available in the SRV during the rainy season.
"There's competition between agribusiness and small farms for labor, but the agribusinesses don't take all of the labor, their needs just aren't that high."
Also agribusinesses like the tomato canning industry have their own regular labor.
"They'll hire temporary labor for periods like seeding and harvesting, but there's still room for small farmers."
"Farmers really need hired labor for harvesting; for the seeding period, they may be able to rely on family labor."
Dr. Fall wouldn't give labor a high weight in the shift from rainy to hot/dry for rice.
"Seeding is not a large constraint because they do it    la vol e , which can be done for one hectare with three people in two days (I think this is just flinging seeds everywhere)."
"Planting in straight lines takes longer, but most people don't do it that way so labor wouldn't push farmers to change their plans."
Labor scarcity is the worst during the rainy season because migrants go back to their own farms.
(Something else about horticulture competition right after this but I didn't catch it.)
"If you have machinery, you just need two people: One to drive, one to guide, no matter the number of hectares."
"If you have one hectare, it's half a day for a machine to do it, 4 - 5 hours."
Then it costs 18%.
"But if you go for manual labor, it might take three people three days (8/hr a day) to harvest one hectare."
"But it also depends on the soil you have, the level of your production."
"Oh,"
yeah!
"During the hot dry season, you have to watch out for the incoming rains."
"If the rains start, it might do a lot of damage to your crop."
Another question is whether you have a humid or dry paddy.
Service providers need to check before they agree to harvest.
Farmers close to Mali and Mauritania may hire migrants from those countries (most of the time Mali.)
And they may also come from Upper Upper Upper Valley.
But most come from Casamance and Kaolack.
Dr. Fall will check on this for us.
"In his opinion, 85% are always using machinery."
It's because they harvest late and they don't have time to go for labor.
"Unless they can't get a provider, they go for the machine."
"It differs slightly between zones, he says if he would say 85% for Delta, it might be 80% for the rest of the zones."
Rice byproducts: The majority of farmers used to leave it in their fields.
But nowadays they have to improve their income
"and they know that livestock consume byproducts, so there's a big trade in Delta for byproducts."
"But in other parts, they leave it there and let their livestock graze on it."
Some industries are using the byproduct to produce charcoal and electricity   but in that case the industries come to glean it for free.
There's a rice miller who diversified his activities to use the husks of rice to generate biofuels.
Very few farmers return it to the soil for organic matter.
"Some farmers are experimenting with this for soil improvement, but Dr. Fall has heard about like, one or two people who do this."
"Most of them burn it, or leave it for livestock, or give it to livestock people and biofuels collectors."
Some of them buy batteuse-ASI (mini-thresher).
But the big ones cost millions and very few coops own them.
NGOs aren't going into this type of service provision either.
Hot/dry
"(SSC): 15th of February, March, April, May, June (rice)"
Rainy (hivernage): Mid-June/July (rains should start mid-June but with climate change it can be later) through around mid-October (appropriate for rice and peanut)
"Cold/dry (SSF): End of November / December into beginning of February (horticulture)

Rainy season can vary between mid-June - Sept or July through mid-October depending on the rains."
"If you're just interested in the farming system and crop maturation, come in late June or July."
"But if you want to see the cropping transition between cold/dry and rainy, coming in April, May or June makes more sense."
We could see horticulture harvests around January and early February (we would see a lot of farms doing onions and tomatoes).
"If we just care about millers, etc., we would come around April where we would see rice on the farm and the commercialization of cold/dry horticulture crops."
"Feb-April we would see the remnants of commercialization of onions and tomatoes, plus the growth of hot/dry rice."
"Besides the bulletins, there are many conference papers and work presentations coming from research colleagues throughout the season."
There are bulletins from ISRA
but they're national and on a yearly basis summarizing research results.
"Every time a cropping season ends, all the agriculture agents are preparing for the next season, so there are a lot of meetings about rice promotion, market access, etc."
These are daily meetings!
"Who's going to crop, what credit and input is needed, etc."
You'll get information from extension and banks.
Dr. Fall is in these meetings because he is ISRA's regional director as well as part of the rice committee that collects questions from farmers and decides how to respond to them.
Actors in St Louis come to ISRA to let him know what they're planning on doing.
First Tuesday every month there's a regional meeting of the heads of service organizations to talk about what they're planning on doing for the next few months.
"During this meeting, each service has to explain what they've been doing and what they plan to do."
Para-statal services that have links with the ministry of agriculture.
"The government has to make periodical agricultural reports, so they get information from ISRA and associates."
These reports and meetings are public.
ISRA is para-statal because the salaries come from the government and they're dedicated to informing the government on which problems exist and what to do about them.
"SAED bulletins
Hivernage confirmed to be wet season, document published in September (during the season)."
"When reading the bulletins, look at when they're released."
"Then, under the  Point Sur  category, they list the content of the bulletin."
They have the past reports for hot/dry and cold/dry which happened before September 2021.
"Every bulletin takes three seasons to make the year, two in the past and one in progress."
"The wet season is marked as 2021/2022 because even if it ends in October, future bulletins will contain the next season that starts in 2022."
"Rule of thumb: Take the first year as the basic year (e.g. 2021), which is counted as the statistics."
Looking at the first page and table.
Dr. Fall says it says that the volume of credit for 2021 is only 35% of the volume of credit in the last year.
Isn't that bad!
"Yes, it's bad!"
"It was unexpected   they expected that the area cultivated would increase, and unfortunately that wasn't the case."
"This means that either the cropping area has reduced, or farmers didn't repay the last season and they didn't get as much credit."
"If we really want to know what's going on, we have to check the land cultivated during last year compared to the area cultivated this year."
"That way we can check if land cultivated has reduced   we just came from COVID, so people might not be getting credit to crop."
So credit disbursal depends both on farmer reimbursement and also farmer willingness to crop more.
( The bank is here to give money! )
Later in the bulletin it talks about reimbursement for September.
"Dr. Fall sees the reimbursement rate of ~52%, and says that the Bank needs 92% + as a recommended rate of reimbursement."
"He says in September the rice from hot/dry may not yet have been sold, so 52% might increase."
Dr. Fall says these numbers indicate the low volume of credit for this season is certainly partly due to the low reimbursement rates.
The bulletin describes the bad credit situation: There's a stock of paddy but it hasn't been sold so the bank doesn't have its money.
Late labor due to COVID restrictions on movement.
Harvest delays due to restricted access to labor and equipment.
"Then the rice gets collected by unions/cooperatives, who seek traders   but it doesn't count as payment until the paddy is sold and the bank is reimbursed."
Sometimes the cooperative is delaying on the paddy looking for a higher price!
He hopes for more reimbursement.
Reimbursement in kind is becoming rare; more often farmers sell the paddy.
"The Naatal Mbay system has farmers sell to millers who reimburse to the banks, which was a guarantee that the paddy given by the farmers would be used automatically by millers to repay credit to the bank."
"When millers take paddy from farmers, the farmers have repaid their credit."
Let's look at the November bulletin!
23 - Nov - 2021.
We're looking at the reimbursement table again (note: for onions!!).
"The average now is 98% for Richard Toll, up to 100% to St. Louis."
Dr. Fall emphasizes how the numbers evolve over time with repaid credit over three months.
"Since people harvest in June or late July, it takes roughly 3 months to collect debts."
"The bulletin says the remaining credit comes from credit loaned on onions, which is supposed to be paid by June   six months between onion harvest and full credit reimbursement!"
One thing we've learned: Make sure you know which crop the table is talking about.
"The table for rice (Table 3) shows that expected hectares is around 56%, within two months of the rainy season."
The last column (Taux R alisation) represents what percentage of the forecast (green) was actually realized.
So the government thought people would plant twice as much area as they did.
"The numbers represent what the government expects at the beginning of the season (not hope, expect.)"
They know the area and the farmers so they expect planting to increase or decrease accordingly.
"Dr. Fall says the predictions in the November document are very, very, very bad predictions."
SAED bases forecasting on several criteria.
Dr. Fall thinks he could do better with these predictions.
He says to give SAED some credit because nobody knows what to predict in a global pandemic!
"Last year there wasn't just COVID, there were bird attacks, incoming political campaigns and other parameters that SAED didn't have access to or control over."
I think this is what Dr. Fall said.)
The government will always defend its ag.
"program (we have better seeds, etc.)"
"and increase subsidies, input access, higher paddy price to make the farmers happy."
"On the other hand, sometimes they try to cheat using false information   we do this and that, when they don't."
Dr. Fall says it might be that SAED was projecting a big win for the government in its forecasts to show that farmers are willing to produce and that self-sufficiency is within reach
but of course that didn't work out during COVID.
So there might be political interests behind this wildly bad prediction.
It's for Lac de Guerre which has a new area for irrigated rice.
Dr. Fall says the area data is being collected for is very small (2700)
so it's not hard to be accurate.
"On the other hand, Bakel's rate is very bad."
Bakel is very far away and they don't have much irrigated infrastructure.
They're not forgotten people but don't get access to programs.
NOTE:
I think this indicates that SAED only collects data for which credit is disbursed and/or irrigation exists.
This explains why the hectares for Bakel are always so tiny.
We look at the reimbursements and they are now higher as expected.
"They get it from the bank itself, which has a department working directly with SAED."
"SAED confirms that farmers have useable land and can repay credit, and the bank wants SAED to pressure farmers to repay loans, so they need to give information to SAED."
They'll tell SAED how much money needs to be repaid by the four Delegations that the SRV is divided up into by the bank.
Dr. Fall confirms the data are very accurate.
"In the September bulletin, it says there's a shortage of fertilizer."
Dr. Fall confirms this is bad.
The government program isn't enough to cover need; it comes late; and the distribution is not even.
"The people who were supposed to get the inputs don't get them, and the big and religious farmers are getting all the inputs."
"If you know farmers haven't gotten fertilizer, and you know that you've passed the point where it ought to have been used already, then it won't improve the crop."
"When you're in the subsidy program, the bank gives you credit for fertilizer."
You have to register at the village level to get the fertilizer.
But that doesn't mean the fertilizer will appear on time.
"On the other hand, you should bring your credit to an input trader and get it on time."
"This is why the farmers are complaining that they want the subsidy program changed, such that farmers can get fertilizer directly related to the price of paddy <<"
I didn't understand this part>>.
"If you do it as part of a subsidy program, well those who can wait, can wait, but you won't get it on time and might not get enough."
"Farmers who want to be punctual get the credit from the bank, go directly to a trader, and then do everything on time."
Yes!
"Everyone believes there's enough water from the river, underground water and the lake."
But the way water is used is hugely wasteful.
"If you're working in a sustainable matter, you have to think about water."
Dr. Fall has discovered a prediction tool made by ANCAR to advise farmers on market information and climate change.
They call it SAIDA.
RiceAdvice is within SAED and AfricaRice; Dr. Fall has a friend who worked on it.
Dr. Fall is our primary expert.
"Paul is the interviewer; Becky, Cheryl and Allegra are also present."
This interview focused on predictables and methodology.
Paul started off the interview by summarizing the project and introducing the predictables problem.
"The environment is changing, lots of uncertainty in market issues."
The biggest unknown might be the level of production.
"Not able to predict the level of production in the future due to uncertain factors, e.g. do farmers have access to inputs, does the credit come in on time, do farmers use technology and machinery or not all of these factors constrain the area cultivated."
Most of the modeling is brought to bear on farmers' behavior to estimate his way of cultivating to guess level of production.
"Agro-ecological zones: Upper Delta, Lower Delta, and just Delta in SRV."
Farmers have different practices and different access to credit and extension services in different zones.
Zones provide a reliably homogeneous grouping of farmers.
"Delta has the most services because it's closest to the services (banking, donors, NGOs, mechanization), and it's the most organized."
"Upper Valley, the Matam/Podor area:"
"Dominated by ethnic groups that have traditional practices, some have land and some don't have any access."
"This area is least predictable, because services are coming into the area but they still have different ways of seeing things."
Lower Delta:
"Farmers are most alone, fewest extension services, some newer public irrigated schemes, land is under national domain law: all land belongs to the government, but people don't apply that law   land belongs to the users, inherited from parents."
They have their own way of delegating access to land.
"Government is trying to deal with this by investing huge amounts in irrigated schemes   they take land from the owners, but they give them some parcels that are irrigated."
Then land is redistributed to farmers and household heads.
"Because women aren't household heads, they get less access / lose access to land."
"The first investment wave was distributed only to men, but now they're doing more irrigation schemes and letting women participate; but the Upper Delta is behind on this."
[Note: I think I had some trouble distinguishing when Dr. Fall was talking about Upper vs Lower Valley.]
"Loans are mostly oriented to access to inputs, use of infrastructure built by the state."
"To get access to inputs, you have to use the government infrastructure."
"If you don't have land, you don't have membership in an organization, so you can't get access to credit   but credit isn't about land, it's about getting people to use the state infrastructure."
Land is your collateral to participate in organizations.
"Credit is about incentivizing farmers to intensify production, that's why the interest rate is so much lower (7.5% vs 21%) than commercial banks."
"SAED is extension agency   it verifies for the bank that the cultivated area declared by the farmers is technically right, i.e. if you cultivate the land, will you be able to pay back the credit."
The bank wants SAED to guarantee that all the farmers expressing input needs are farmers that will produce and produce enough.
"SAED is the intermediary giving the technical advice, e.g.  This community of farmers has good land."
"Farmers' union/cooperative collects  expression of needs , goes to bank and says,  We'll be cultivating 50 hectares  , and then SAED has to send an extension agent to give a technical notice approving that the farmers actually have and can cultivate 50 hectares."
"If one farmer is not paying back, the entire coop gets penalized!"
"The coop will take that one guy's land and give it to someone else, and the lucky recipient pays the portion of the loan, so the bank doesn't know that someone has defaulted."
They hold the one guy
's land hostage until he can pay his portion of the loan back.
Loans take forever.
"Banks need to get approval from the Ministry of Finance, a guarantee that whatever happens, the government will foot the bill."
It was taking a really long time.
"Things are improving, but there's heavy administrative involvement."
"The bank doesn't want to be involved when there's large costs, so they rely on SAED to do the legwork, so everything takes forever."
Farmers might receive the credit one or two months later.
Farmers in coops that plant at different times do so because they face a few problems:
"Access to credit is slow, but it can be slowed down even more by the fact that if you don't sell your crop on time, then you can't pay back your loan on time, so you don't get credit on time."
"Also, some coops are more professional and organized than others."
If farmers aren't acting in unison then things take too long.
"Another issue is the access to mechanization services, e.g. for harvest; service providers are not always ready on time to provide the services farmers need."
There aren't enough service providers with enough equipment; some equipment sometimes isn't adapted to the land (e.g. the big harvesters won't be able to handle small parcels).
"There are a lot of parameters in a model of production   if you want to plant different crops, you have to choose which ones."
"Cold season, you plant horticulture, the other season you do rice."
"But if you do a hot rice season plus the rainy season, you don't have time to plant on time for rainy season (Feb - May, then immediate turnaround.)"
So some farmers prefer to do horticulture in cold season so there's time to sell and start rice in the rainy season.
"What you want to plant doesn't just depend on timing, but also on market demand."
"Last year, for example, Senegal produced a LOT of potatoes but lost a lot of them because they're not easy to commercialize."
"Now, this year, farmers don't want to grow potatoes; they've gone to onion."
"So what you plant this year depends on how it went last year, which means it's really hard to predict."
"The kind of fertilizer depends on the kind of crops, so you need to decide early and you have to hope that the input suppliers (fertilizer, seeds) have predicted what you want to grow."
"These decisions are made around November and December   you plan what you're going to do in the next year, i.e. you don't just decide one season but how the seasons work together."
Regulation market agencies are new organizations made by the government to help farmers monitor what the market needs and predict what's needed.
"That is, they hold imports until they know how much farmers have produced, so the domestic product doesn't get swamped."
Horticulture is all for commercialization.
20 - 30% of rice is for subsistence but horticulture is for market.
"The farther you are from Dakar, the more of your own rice you eat."
You don't get credit for horticulture because it's not a government priority.
"For the tomato industry, there's a similar system with SAED and banks, but onion isn't tied to any private sector organizations (just traders), so there isn't credit."
"Cotton, peanut, rice and tomatoes are the only crops with easy access to credit."
"If you can't get credit (maybe because you didn't pay), then horticulture is a good option because you might make more money even than rice."
"But inputs are more expensive for horticulture than rice, so the payoff is higher but so is the investment."
"If you're doing rice, you can have a formal contract with millers where you pay in kind."
"If they're in a cooperative, they are affected by what the cooperative does."
They're influenced by the group.
"But if they own their own plot, most of the time it comes down to whatever they want to do."
"SAED agents provide advice, e.g.  We know from the agency that potatoes' price might be low and Senegal might import a lot of them."
"Your own experience will make up about 50% of your field decision   you know your field, you might not have the same issues as others, maybe you have a different method or you know better traders, you know exactly the productivity your land is capable of giving you, the fertilizer you have leftover from last year, etc."
E.g. I have a bag of fertilizer leftover
so I'll do onions because I have a head start.
Dr. Fall says we ought to talk to 10 to 15 farmers to verify and expand on the information on he's given us.
"ISRA is a rural development institution, working in five domains: crops and fisheries and livestock and forestry and socioeconomics."
"Divided into five departments: Horticulture, fishery, forestry, livestock health and animal science, and social science & politics that focuses on macroeconomics and policy."
Within the national department there are regional stations inside the AEZs.
"the one in the SRV; there's one in the peanut basin that works with peanut, cowpeas, millet and sorghum; there's another working on cotton and maize (didn't catch location); one in Casamance working with rainfed rice (e.g. mangrove cropping); and one in Koldar, CLZ, that works mainly on livestock."
All of these regional centers are part of one or another of the five departments that have the previously listed focuses.
"ISRA is funded for salary by the government, for research they get funding internationally from places like CGIAR, AfricaRice, etc."
"The government pays operating costs, so they cover the extension."
ISRA does public research so its results are public.
"Also, ISRA sells  foundation  seeds of new cultivars to seed producers."
"Other than these things, ISRA doesn't provide extension services."
They train extension workers to be able to diffuse new technologies but don't do the extension themselves.
Dr. Fall's funding mainly comes from other organizations through proposals.
Dr. Fall hears about AI as something people are interested in for funding.
"He has done a 30-year risk analysis with the World Bank on the agricultural/livestock chain, using an econometric framework   dissecting the resilience strategies farmers used in the last 30 years to deal with risk from different sources (e.g. low rainfall) and evaluating the social and economic consequences."
"Yes, every time they have a research project they want to work with the extension agency in their zone."
"So they work with SAED, ANCAR, farmers' organization, and NGOs / AfricaRice / ICRISAT."
"~ Diagram time ~
Dr. Fall says there can be positive or negative effects of climate change on harvest time."
"Climate change might shorten the cropping season, and then, yes, it can lead to cropping damage (e.g. if it rains at the wrong time)."
He approved other parts of the diagram.
~Agronomy
"Most farmers are always using above the recommended quantity, because they say the quality of the fertilizer is not good they give any kind of explanation to justify using more."
The recommended is 150 kilos of DAP in three different phases.
"What they observe is that farmers are always using higher quantity, which is surprising because the cost is high."
"Sometimes they say the plot is not flat enough, so the fertilizer shifts when they add water!"
This varies over zones.
"In the Delta zone, people use more than the recommended."
"In other zones, people are concerned by the fertilizer cost, so they use less in terms of quantity."
"There's a recommended practice of applying in three different phases, but some farmers don't follow this practice either."
"Some wait too long between applications, depending if they received loans or if fertilizer is available."
This ought to be predictable if you know about credit access and physical access to fertilizer.
Farmers receive  bon de credit  (credit vouchers) to go get fertilizer.
"You might not be able to get as much fertilizer as you want, or the operator might not have the kind you want."
Sometimes farmers will use 9/9/33 formula instead of 18/46/00 formula because it's not available.
"Because of subsidy programs, international importers don't like to go through Senegal; and sometimes within subsidy programs, there's not enough fertilizer; so everyone has to switch to a similar fertilizer that still isn't what they want."
These switches might change how and when farmers apply it.
"Researchers make the recommendations, but it was a LONG time ago (sixties/seventies)."
There wasn't any potassium; the fertilizer was 18/46/00.
"In the last few years with the support from USAID, they want to change the formula and the recommended quantity."
"But currently, farmers are still using more than recommended."
Farmers from their own experiences (because farmers are researchers too!)
"know the old recommendations are out of date, so they follow their own knowledge."
The primary complaint is that the existing fertilizer isn't good quality (hence the increased application.)
"Dr. Fall agrees that there's an opportunity to provide recommendations about fertilizer based on soil type, etc."
But he says few people know what their soil type is.
"He says that fewer than 1% of farmers use ISRA labs to analyze their soil, but you need to know about the soil before you can make any recommendation about fertilizer."
Any farmer in Senegal has the right to subsidized fertilizer.
"But depending on the crop you're growing, the fertilizer changes."
"The government lets farmers know that certain fertilizers are for certain crops (e.g. DAP is for rice and horticulture producers, which includes formulas like 9/9/20)."
They may provide up to 55% subsidy.
Then they choose three or four importers to bring in fertilizer to be subsidized.
"But those importers who aren't selected by the program might import still to re-export to the Gambia, Mauritania, Mali."
Everyone knows the government can't satisfy all demands.
"But people who can't access the subsidy programs are also not satisfied by the market, and the price is too high for non-subsidized fertilizer, as well as scarce because importers go out-of-country to avoid the subsidy program."
Subsidy program penalizes both the fertilizer market and the use of fertilizer.
It hamstrings importers and makes it difficult for farmers who can't get the subsidized fertilizer to get other fertilizer.
"Even the selected importers complain, because they're sometimes paid late and they aren't told in advance that they'll be the selected importers."
"They could be buying fertilizer for cheap on the off-season, but they're not notified until the start of the season when the international market price is very high."
"The government uses the subsidies to encourage certain crops but in practice, the fertilizer doesn't arrive on time, and farmers' over-application wastes around 30% of the fertilizer."
There's a dilemma about whether the program is actually helping.
Farmers are saying they want subsidies on the paddy price (e.g. selling at 200 instead of 150) instead of on the fertilizer.
"The agriculture minister said,  Sure,  but they need a study to show whether the fertilizer subsidy program actually worked."
Subsidy program is distributed at the village level.
"The committee that distributes it ought to contain civil servants, farmers, etc. to make sure distribution is fair."
It was said that big farmers and religious leaders who call themselves farmers were profiting unfairly from distribution.
But now the committees have been restructured such that farmers are represented by their coop leaders.
"Complaints about fairness have reduced, though farmers still want aid with paddy price, not fertilizer."
"Maybe for crops that aren't supported by credit, but most of the time they use fertilizer for rice, and when the cropping time comes from tomato and onion, they get fertilizer through the same system."
"However, in the rainfed zone, cash crops always receive fertilizer and food crops do not."
"Unless there's some program giving out fertilizer for food crops, and then people will even take that fertilizer and apply it to their cash crops."
"But in the irrigated zone, fertilizer is applied to the crop you got credit for."
Other crops are likely growing on the residual fertilizer from last season.
There are different water management systems.
"If you're in a public irrigated system, it's lended to farmers by the state through their cooperatives."
Those are being paid for by hectare in the Delta zone.
"Closer to Podor, you're paying more to access irrigation."
"But the cost of irrigation isn't linked to the amount of water you use, just by the hectares owned by the farmer."
"If you're in a private, village-type system, you're using moto-pumpes and paying for gas."
"Everybody pays their share of gas by hectares, including the salary of the pump operator."
Dr. Fall says Senegal loses a lot of money through the public scheme because it's not charged based on the amount of water and people do whatever they want.
"They believe water is endless, but that's not always the case."
Coops work together to get water to everyone's fields.
Big  schemes (grand management) were created by the government and then given to coops to manage.
Big = 3000 to 5000 hectares.
The pump schemes are called  village type.
They also work in cooperatives but the currency is gas used.
At the end of the season they divide costs of gas up based on farmer hectares.
"There's a third,  private irrigated scheme , where single farmers pay the water management organization of four countries called OMVS <not sure if I understood this>."
Some villages build irrigation on their own but roughly because they see the benefits but don't have the money to do it correctly.
"Sometimes they are helped by NGOs, e.g. program in Matam with African Bank."
"Types of irrigation itself within each scheme like drip irrigation (goutte a goutte), furrow irrigation (irrigation   la raie)."
Irrigation is more or less included in the credit package.
"There's a part of payment that goes to OMVS, a part that goes to SAED which is responsible for irrigation infrastructure maintenance."
Coops themselves should keep clean the specific farm accesses.
"If it's your day to irrigate, you can control that your farm fills up with water and close the output gates until you have enough water for your farm before you permit the next person to access water."
That's the only control you have.
"After that, you have to bring water in or wait your turn again."
You decide as a group who gets water in which order.
If you really need water you can request that you have your turn.
"Dr. Fall says the government thinks that combining irrigation into the credit loan is the best way to get farmers to pay for irrigation, because farmers don't even know that the charges are slipped in there."
The difference in cost between public and private depends on how you get water from the river to your land.
"The cost itself is the same, by hectare, but the difficulty may change."
"It's the coops' decision, because they already have access to the irrigation system."
SAED only maintains the primary channels and principle access.
It should be the same as rice.
The only change might be to work within the plot to create furrows (billons) to protect onions or tomatoes from too much water.
"If you're not double cropping rice, then yes, sometimes you grow vegetables in the off season."
"But some farmers only plant in one season, and they either specialize in rice or in tomatoes or onions."
"It is possible to get three crops out of a plot, but it takes a lot of time, effort and attention."
"You have to make sure to harvest on time, clean up the plot, that you have the money to get the inputs you need on time (you have your own money or you go to another lender), etc."
"For the season we already know what crops are appropriate:  Rice is appropriate or not, horticulture too."
"Now the land:  If you have a lot of salt, you have to choose rice."
Any farmer knows his land characteristics.
Second step:  Which crops are relevant for market demand.
Last season's performance influences this season's choice.
Because we don't actually know what the market wil do
", farmers rely on last season's performance."
"Third: availability of seeds:  For horticulture   tomatoes, onions,  seeds are imported."
Not for rice but for vegetables.
Seed price matters.
There used to be more cooperative control: The cooperative rules of water regulation stay.
"Mostly people try to do the same thing for rice, even down to the variety."
Cooperatives were mainly for rice.
Now they extend to tomatoes.
"But for other crops, it's the farmer's own decision."
I think this varies by season:
In rice-growing season they work much more uniformly than in other seasons.
"The farmers discuss what to grow collectively and how much credit they need;  people can opt in or out, so there's a discussion of who will grow what and how much they need so that the coop can try to get credit."
"Finally, access to an industrial firm: Tomatoes and rice are the only things that have contracts between farmers and coops or processors."
"only rice, peanuts, cotton, tomatoes facilitate access to credit (the mechanism isn't clear but  the firm  facilitates)."
"If you have savings, you might go  contrarian  and plant onions; if you are planting what everyone else plants because they need access to credit (e.g., tomatoes), your prices will be low."
"Hot dry season: the majority will do rice but you might see peanuts, maybe potatoes, not in the SRV but in the Koalack lake region."
"Hot dry: March - June/july
Cold dry: Oct- late february
Rainy season: July - Aug/sept."
"(rice, potatoes, millet or sorghum in the recession floodplain)"
"Yes, but not hard enough."
"If you know what happened last season: If last year everyone planted onions but prices were low, then they'll probably change."
Farmers are  imitative :  If you go for tomatoes then perhaps someone else will go for onions.
"Are they influenced by community leaders:  Yes, they are influenced by leaders and by the  big farmers  or  drivers    you always can see the more successful ones and they tend to influence others."
If you know the group leaders that may help to predict the decisions about what to grow.
Question 2:  Can we predict whether a coop or others will get sufficient inputs  in time .
The coop is very important in distributing credit and input.
"The management of the cooperatives will favor farmers who do all the right things (e.g., paying back loans)."
Some coops are more powerful than others.
Credit is to the individual but under the guarantee of the coop.
The bank itself depends on the financial market; it doesn't have enough money itself to satisfy demand.
"It needs to raise funds from the financial market, guaranteed by the government."
"SAED does irrigation scheme infrastructure, extension agents and at the same time is an intermediary between the coops and the banks."
"SAED also helps the coops organize their decisions, even the water distribution decisions and rebuilding / maintaining (by hiring contractors)."
Deputy director of SAED; Abdoulaye can put us in touch.
"Question 3: When would they plant, which are the relevant factors."
2-3 mos before the cropping season is the time at which you'd make a decision.
Access to credit and input.
There are input traders who sell seed etc.
Having these people around may be a factor.
"If you are in Ross Bethio, or near, then you can get all the input you want."
But the choice of which crop sorta depends on which seeds are available and those closer to towns have more access.
"We don't have seed operators for tomatoes, onions, etc b/c these seeds are imported; seed potatoes are seeing a local industry"
"It depends on the crop, each requires different practices."
land isn't so good.
"They might use  old  seed rather than improved seed, the interval between flooding and seeding etc vary locally and may be more or less governed by tradition"
Education matters a lot.
SRV has the most educated farmers compared with Senegal overall.
The majority of farmers are illiterate but in the SRV the organizations are led by people with BS and MS degrees.
"Big difference in yield, adoption of technology,."
These leaders set up their own task force and have big influence in policy and subsidy programs; even the price of rice is influenced by this group.
"In the upper delta, women get access to land but less than in the delta because the inheritance of land is patrilineal."
The availability of equipment for land prep is another factor.
If you don't have access you might switch to a different crop.
"There is a lot of choice about what to plant, though it depends on the season."
In rainy season
"it's rice, maize, peanut; in cold dry season it's vegetables."
Is there ready access to pesticides and are farmers well informed about pest dynamics:  Yes:  you have many products; which you use depends on the crop and the pest/weeds etc.
The cost of pesticides are included in the package of  input credit  organized by the coops.
Should we try to predict pest infestations:
"Yes, it's one of the main constraints in SRV."
A colleague monitors ~100 weed problems and diseases.
Farmers don't know the differences and probably don't use the right products.
Focus of interview: Decision-making of farmers and the predictions we might make.
Topic: Climate change.
"Yes, he thinks so:"
"For example, the rice yields have been decreasing and temperatures have been higher."
CC has shifted how farmers should be running their seasons.
"Farmers plant more in the dry season, because the wet season is more inconsistent in the start-time and amount of rain."
"Farmers can control water more with irrigation in the dry season, so they rely on that time period more."
"The increased rain in the wet season has also increased the number of pests, which can bleed into the dry season if farmers haven't prepared the land properly (e.g. setting fire to the soil to kill the pests before planting the next crop.)"
"They know about climate change, but the main impact they experience is the yield reduction and the amount of rain that's been happening in the North of Senegal   used to not rain much"
but now it's raining more and more and the start of the season is coming earlier than before.
They have a connection with a local institution called Anacim which promotes information about CC and when the planting window for the dry season will be.
"SAED doesn't adjust its suggestions based on Anacim because they give the information too late, after the sowing season."
"SAED just says  You should sow earlier, or you'll suffer so-and-so risk."
"However, subsidies are also coming late."
"Though if farmers have savings, if the supply is available, they can buy earlier."
There are cultivars usually used for the dry season and the wet season respectively   it depends on the duration of the cycle.
"When they start the wet season early, they use a long duration cultivar; for the dry season they always use the short duration cultivar."
AfricaRice has some cultivars that they distribute.
There's also seed stations which certify the seeds
but it's not very strict   lots of farmers have complained that seeds aren't getting certified properly.
Either farmers get seeds from the stations or from another farmer who has kept seeds.
But seed quality is a big problem.
Seed stations are public institutions which decide where the seeds go.
"The role of last season:
Pape agrees that you can probably predict t + 1 based on t. The choices change if the previous season wasn't that good."
"If it was not that good, they take action before the start of the growing season."
"If it goes well, they do the same thing."
"Lately, if rice doesn't go well, they switch varieties, but Pape says usually they don't switch crops because rice is very important financially [NOTE: recalling that Pape's experience is with rice growers in Manobi]."
He's seen farmers doing horticulture like salad and tomato
"but it's not horticulture instead of rice, it's horticulture AND rice on two different plots."
Plant short duration seeds in dry season because there's a short window for harvest.
"The timing of harvest is linked to CC   because the start of the rainy season is coming earlier and earlier each year, they have to harvest before it arrives or the soil will be wet and the harvesters won't be able to pass over the soil."
They harvest early to protect themselves from the consequences of CC.
"It also depends on whether the bird pressure is high, which changes from season to season   sometimes they're there, sometimes they're not."
But it is better to harvest early because you don't want the birds to come at the end of the season and eat your harvest.
SAED doesn't provide information about whether they should harvest early or not   they just make the judgment themselves.
SAED just advises to always sow the earliest possible.
Farmers that harvest earlier tend to have better yields: 2 - 3 tons earlier.
"There's a window for harvest in rice and if you harvest later, the yields decrease."
"If you sow earlier and harvest at the ideal time, you also are more likely to get access to harvesting equipment."
Farmers sow late due to access to inputs and credit.
"Even if they sow early, they might not have access to a harvester, so they might be waiting for a month to get access."
The harvesters are also too big and if the soil is wet then they can't easily move through.
Investors are now starting to shift to the mini harvester.
Farmers that plant early and harvest early in one season can double crop.
Access to harvesters is a financial problem.
"Pape has seen this year some harvesters that are being financed by banks, but the one who owns the harvester has to pay back the loan."
"If the farmer has a little area, the people who own the harvester won't feel like going from plot to plot because transportation costs a lot (need a big car, need to pay for the gas)."
"They're interested in 20 - 50 ha plots, maybe 10 ha, not smaller plots."
"Harvesters will start in the North of the valley and do little plots, and then they go to Mauritania to work on 50 ha plots because they have to pay back loans quickly."
"At the start of June there's plenty available, but by July all the harvesters have gone."
"Small coops and farmers lose out, but they can also do manual harvesting (very slow) or try to get a mini harvester."
"If a farmer can't get machinery and doesn't have enough household labor, they hire migrants who come up the south of Senegal."
They are specialized in this kind of work and have the reputation of doing it very fast; farmers prefer to hire migrants if they can't get access to a big harvester.
"If farmers miss the optimal sowing window in the wet season, they plant with a short cycle duration crop."
Pape says people don't usually choose crops depending on the characteristics of the soil   they choose depending on whether they're in the window of sowing or not.
They do consider the salinity of the soil; they'll use salt-resistant crops.
But they don't usually know the characteristics of their soil past salinity.
Salinity is the biggest problem along the border with Mauritania.
"Maybe from the amount of rain you can predict there will be a lot of pests, but farmers don't have information besides that to protect themselves."
They will often leave their field fallow if there are too many pests.
"Farmers might also abandon if the salinity is too high, or if they plant a few times and the yields are declining, they'll leave the field to fallow."
"When the rice matures, if the soil is water-saturated and the rice has started to go yellow, they know it's ready to harvest."
"They will only harvest if they have the tools available, but they do know when they should harvest."
Big shortage in migrant labor due to COVID   most farmers were 30 to 40 days late in harvesting and lost a lot of yields.
A lot of financial institutions had issues because they didn't get their money back.
But the state has supported the financial institutions to keep farmers in loans.
"They gave grants to the financial institutions depending on the amount of issues in the plots, as supervised by SAED (e.g. this plot had issues on 50% of the land)."
So the banks get wired repayment from the state for the amount of damage estimated; the leftovers can be repaid by farmers over 1 or 2 years.
Insurance is part of getting credit from a bank   the bank has a partnership with an insurance company.
Pape thinks the farmers don't feel that the damage of the plots were evaluated fairly   they want to be paid back 100%   but Pape himself thinks it was fair.
"He knows of two coops who got paid back 50% and thinks this is fair since they harvested, after all."
Pape doesn't know of any other labor shortages before COVID.
He says it usually isn't an issue to have intra-Senegal migration.
People stay on the farm for four to five months just to work on the farm.
"Usually when the farmer has been financed by the bank, they have to have a contract with a buyer."
"But for this season with La Banque Agricole, even if farmers have a contract with the buyer they won't always respect it because sometimes the third party buyers have a better price."
"The farmers say, wait until we sell our rice to the third party buyers and then we will pay you [the bank] back, and the bank just goes along with it."
Intermediaries are only for the local consumption.
Other buyers have their own people who go to the farms to buy directly.
Pape says they sell at the coop level if the coop itself has the loan.
The farmers will store the repayment rice for one month to see if the price will go higher (usually there's a glut) and then they will sell.
Usually they put the rice into two parts   one to go to loan repayment and one to share between farmers and individual consumption.
Farmers will harvest at night to sell on the side.
This happens fairly often.
"If the cost of storage is high, or if they want to go to the next season very fast, or pay back as soon as possible to have a loan for the next season will influence how quickly a farmer sells."
Farmers who struggled with loan repayment in the past tend to wait to sell because they want a better price but they also don't know if they pay the loan back whether they will get a loan again.
"The bank might not automatically give them another loan even if they pay their loan back, so they want to make sure they get enough money from the rice they do have."
"If they have enough $ leftover from selling, they'll make a payment   or there's a verbal agreement with the bank,  If you give me the money back I'll guarantee you another loan."
[Note: I think this means that the time of repayment is less important than the scale of repayment.
It's better to sell late and repay more than sell early and repay less].
Manobi has also been asking themselves this question.
"For a farmer to pay back his loan is a luxury   the farmer is not obliged to repay, the environment is not set up for the farmers to repay every time."
They don't have constraints   the police don't come and take away the farm   it depends on the farmer to pay back or not.
"The farmer wants to pay back if he knows if he'll get another loan, or if there are other advantages, e.g. getting a harvester loan, etc."
"Some farmers don't pay back their loans even if they have a good season   they're eager to keep their money, we never know."
ACDI: Dr. Fall doesn't recall anything about this USAID project.
ACDI_CIDA: International Canadian development agency.
"It's mainly a donor, working in the agriculture sector as well as in livestock."
"ISRA used to have a project with them, mainly on rice."
"Work with different institutions, in the case of the SRV they work with ISRA by financing rice projects, not only variety development but also promoting artisanal tools for mechanization."
(In French they call it ACDI because that's how French works.)
They also work with AfricaRice.
"They're part of a subregional task force on rice and agriculture equipment, including Mali, etc."
Also involved with millers.
"Dr. Fall says the project ended two years ago, so right now you couldn't call them important; but two years ago they were putting mechanization as the focal point."
No current projects that Dr. Fall knows about.
"AFD: French government donor, financing a research project called OneHealth about human being and livestock health, integrated human-livestock rural development project (ongoing)."
"Dr. Fall used to have a project with them on analyzing the price of rice and the power of stakeholders over the rice price in the rice value chain, aiding farmers to fix the paddy rice."
"They work in different parts of Senegal, including the SRV, but they're nationwide and they have different interests."
AfricaRice: Specialize in rice research.
"Work in all rice ecologies in Senegal, but they're based in the SRV because it's irrigated."
Also working on rainfed and mangrove ecologies.
"Not only in Senegal, they are in 24 African countries (West, Central and East Africa)."
They mainly work with national research institutes to provide advice and technology.
Ongoing projects.
Also involved in rice policy.
Affiliated with CGIAR and associated with national research institutes of the countries they're in.
Originally in just West African countries.
"In Senegal, they work with ISRA and SAED."
They also work with farmers directly to do field trials.
They train both farmers directly and extension agencies.
they work with SAED for diffusion of innovations.
AGRA:
Regional organization working mainly on seeds with seed operators.
They provide services to private sector to improve seeds.
"They work with ISRA and seed operators, mainly the private sector."
"They reinforce the capacity of seed operators and maintain relationships between ISRA and the private sector, developing business and market for improved seeds."
"Both capacity development on the side of seed operators but also business development, pushing private sector to invest in improved seeds."
"Ongoing projects, based in Ghana and Nigeria."
"ANACIM: Government-based agency, working on meteorological information like forecasting."
They sell information to SAED and ISRA!
Ongoing.
"ANCAR: Rural development national extension agency, supposed to provide extension services to all farmers in different crops and different sectors."
"They deal with agriculture, livestock, fisheries, etc."
They're a government agency with free services.
Funded by the World Bank and other donors.
"The World Bank supported the first ANCAR program, with the plan that at the end of the project ANCAR would depend on farmers to be financed; now they are supported by many donors, including Banque Agricole."
"ANCAR acts as a mediator between organizations and farmers; if it's a bank, it's going through ANCAR."
"ANCAR does what SAED does, on a national multi-crop scale."
"ANCAR is also in the SRV, but it leaves the rice advising to SAED and handles horticulture in the SRV."
Whenever there's already an extension agency doing something specific (like SAED with rice) it orients itself towards other crops.
SAED came before ANCAR.
Example: Decision-making tool called SAIDA.
"trying to link agencies together with a multi-state project (ISRA, SAED, ANCAR)."
"But SAED has fought to preserve their role on rice in any matter, so ANCAR was wise and trains farmers in agricultural practices and stays out of rice."
SAIDA: Decision-making tool.
New innovation to predict for farmers and provide market information.
"Instead of having lots of in-person sessions, they send texts."
"In Ndiaye the horticulture region, Kaolack, etc."
ASPRODEB:
Farmer's organization
but they try to be NGO.
They position themselves as farmer's organization to provide advice to farmers (e.g. new crops and technologies) and to preserve farmers' interests in price discussions and subsidies.
They do both lobbying and training.
"They work with ISRA, SAED, ANCAR and all organizations working in the agriculture sector."
"Their main focus is to develop farmer capacity building, so they want to be involved any new extension or development programs."
(Didn't catch that).
"They work everywhere in Senegal, including SRV."
Ongoing and VERY active.
APIX:
"Government agency helping foreign and national investors to get access to value and market information, facilitating business agreements and reducing taxes to encourage investment in private sector."
Very active.
BNDE: Banque Agricole (used to be CNCAS).
"Biggest interaction is with farmers, government and private enterprise."
Objective is to finance the agriculture sector.
"They set loan rates, etc."
"BOS-PSE: PSE is a government orientation document, strategy document, vision document."
Each new president outlines his vision in a new PSE.
BOS: Bureau that monitors the activities of the government done to fulfill the PSE.
BOS advertises the successes of the current government in achieving the PSE (seems vaguely political / propaganda in election years).
"They finance infrastructure projects like roads, milling industries."
BRM: Subregional market stock exchange ( bourse ).
Probably not very related to rice or the AVC.
CDS: Unknown.
"CERAAS: Branch of ISRA, working on dryland crops and working in the West African subregion on millet, sorghum and cowpea."
"It's just one center of ISRA, working with the larger subregional institute and also with ICRISAT on cereal crops."
"Not relevant to rice, but rice-related crops and biotechnology."
Very active.
CGER:
"Helps farmers develop efficient management and business plans and financial documents, building capacity among farmers and millers to be able to file tax reports, financial training, etc."
Private sector: Farmers pay to get advice on their enterprises.
Active.
CIRIZ: Inter-profession organization.
Rice stockholder association.
"It's a method of having policy dialogues between stakeholders in the rice value chain, supervising government interventions in rice, supervising extension agencies working in rice, deciding the price of paddy each year."
"Created in the SRV, but they've extended their association to Casamance to include rice farmers in Casamance and other rainfed zones."
Work with the government   they're invited to participate in the development of any rice programs.
"Involved in any services provided to the rice sector as a lobbying actor, including ISRA."
Very active.
"<< Dr Fall said something important towards the end (4:22 pm) about how ANCAR and SAED handle personnel, but I missed it! >>"
The Delta area has the same characteristics.
The blue is what they call the Delta itself.
But there's low Delta and upper Delta.
"something about big irrigated scheme, 3 - 4k irrigated hectares are the end of the Delta area."
Green is Moyenne-Vallee (mid-Valley) - amont (mid-Valley-upper)
Pink is Moyenne-Vallee (mid-Valley) - aval (mid-Valley-lower)
After Matam you go to the High Valley (beyond the pink) up to Bakel
(then you get to Faneye which is where Middle Valley starts)
Bakel has less rice because less irrigation.
Tomato is mostly in Dagana and the onions are supposed to be Podor (Dr Fall confirms the data confirm his expectations.)
"SAED has a bulletin it publishes every month, but you couldn't have enough data from that to record what's needed."
"If we can write a letter to the SAED director through the embassy or ICRISAT in a formal way, it would be easiest to get those data."
Dr Fall can get the data but it's difficult to do with incomplete results.
"SAED is divided into delegations which is what they call Upper Delta, etc."
"SAED is supposed to be the ones who collect the data in the SRV, working with DAPSA (ag."
stats in the ministry of agriculture) to compile into nationwide database.
Other places like ISRA or USAID might have data but it's on a case study basis depending on the projects.
Dr. Fall did a baseline study and an impact assessment for Naatal Mbay.
Program coordinator used to be a colleague of Dr. Fall's.

Onion glut"
"Yes, he guesses   all those constraints Cheryl mentioned are real, they exist in the onion VC."
Lots of farmers picked onions because it's more economically profitable than rice.
There's also government support through market regulation (stopping import of onions until local onions are sold.)
"Law of supply and demand determines that if everyone floods onions, the price drops."
"People will claim that regulation is failing and people are importing onions, but that's not the case."
"Regulation is put in place by the commission (go back to this, I missed it, there's some kind of board or something.)"
"But agribusinesses aren't importing, but they're not really  local  either   they have better technology, storage, etc."
So the quality is as high as imported onions and they're still squashing the little farmers.
"We can predict that kind of thing because regulations encourage people to produce more, but the regulations don't necessarily cover all cases (e.g. agribusiness)."
"Holidays have big demand for onion or other things   Sheep Day, etc."
Podor is the leading onion producing region but the problem is everywhere at different scales.
"Regardless of region, they're all producing onion in the cold/dry season and there's no storage infrastructure and the quality is lower than required at market by consumers 

Onion glut makes life easier for tomato growers!"
"If you use your plot for onion, you don't have space for tomatoes."
Plots are just really small.
International market impacts domestic onion price.
"Senegal gets onions from Holland, Scandinavia, France"
they're price-takers not price-givers.
"If there's not a lot of onion internationally and you're not producing a lot locally, you can't shield yourself from price hikes."
"If you have a good local production of onion and you have an increase in the world market, the competition is unfair because imported onion is higher quality (unless you use the local onion, like, NOW.)"
People know they can store imported onions but not local onions.
Dr. Fall overheard ladies complaining that local onions have too much water.
check this).
Government is highly intervening.
"Government intervention is so implied and so heavy, far beyond information-service nudges."
"Dr. Fall thinks market regulation is not bad, seeing as you're dealing with small farmers who need protection from competition."
It's a way of reinforcing capacity.
Because it's profitable.
"But for this year, the conditions were really good for onions and you expect to have a market while imports are stopped."
Also now people might be better at cropping onion than they used to be.
"Onions you also have less damage than other crops, even though there's still weeds and stuff."
"Also, last year's onion price was high (check this, it's a hypothetical), so everyone switches to onion."
Podor soil is more appropriate for onion than rice.
"Yes, it's one of their missions, to give better information to farmers."
"They should be able to advise farmers to do other crops based on information from the market, availability of technology for seed, etc."
They have a lot of information they can use to advise farmers whether they'll succeed in crops.
But farmers make the ultimate decision.
"Market Regulation Agency gets world market information and National Agency for Demography and Statistics, ANCAR extension, NGOs, etc. are all talking to farmers."
"You can guess   if you're in the field you see a lot of opportunities for onions for farmers, the world market is growing onion production,   Dr Fall believes this coming year will be difficult because they're producing a lot of onion and the price will be low compared to what farmers think it is."
"E.g. Not only Podor is doing onions but now regions that usually do tomato are also doing onions, so you think it'll be a bad year for a lot of people."
And you can look at the world market and see production is also increasing.
[Note: I can't tell if this is a hypothetical or not.]
>
"Yes I think this is a hypothetical, later when asked to bet, Dr Fall says he needs to go collect information about the field and world market price."
"FOR RICE, Dr Fall predicts that with the world market, the push for self-sufficiency and COVID-19, and how people are shifting to local rice and farmers are improving the quality and production of rice   next year there will be more local production of rice and also more demand."
"Urban population is increasing daily, also migration from rural to urban ( last year was not a good year ) and demand is increasing from urban markets."
"However, a large part of local production still goes to local consumption."
IR-15 was a good cultivar before Sahel-108.
Breeders were choosing Sahel-108 for urban consumers.
But they want something for local consumption.
Sahel-108 is 90-105 days which is short/medium cycle.
"It used to be the producing zone was only consuming local rice, St Louis etc., but urban consumers and non-producing rural consumers were eating imported rice."
Gov't used to control all aspects of rice production under  equalization  where it was collected and distributed amongst rural production areas.
Urban consumers didn't even know how to prepare local rice.
"Recently 15 cultivars were released, but Sahel-108 is still preferred amongst consumers and rainfed producers in Kaolack and Casamance (because of its short cycles)."
It wasn't supposed to be a cultivar for those zones.
People are starting to use ISRE-10 and ISRE-5
but they really prefer Sahel-108.
"Yield is an indicator of choosing Sahel-108, it's always between 5 and 6.5 tons/ha."
But it's 8 - 10 t/ha in potential yield.
Even SAED says 6.5 because farms never get over 5 - 6.5 tons/ha.
"People say the average yield in SRV is 6.5, but Dr. Fall doubts it."
6.5 is an upper limit of the best farmers.
This is a conflict he's been having with SAED!
Dr Fall is surprised too and people ask this a lot.
"This was his first paper with Africa Rice, the impact of Sahel-108, thirty years ago."
Sahel-108 and Sahel-201 are primarily used.
"15 cultivars have been around for only 5 years, but they're asking why Sahel-108 has stuck around."
Podor =
"Delta
Beyond Podor ="
"Upper Delta
Delta, Upper Delta, and Valley
Valley starts in Matam up to Bakel

Between St. Louis, before Podor, at Dagana   between St. Louis and Dagana is the Delta Zone
St Louis to Ross Bethio is Lower Delta / Bas-Delta"
But Lower Delta is within the Delta which extends to Dagana
"Dagana to Matam is called Upper, Upper Upper Delta
Matam is after Podor
After Matam is called the Vall e
Within the Valley, you can call it Low Valley, Upper Valley and High Valley
But the main area in Valley is Delta Valley (Matam to Bakel)"
Sometimes villages have the same name as the departments (administrative districts / regions).
Used to belong to St. Louis
but now they have their own districts.
"Dagana is a secondary town now in terms of population and infrastructure, but it's still an agricultural town."
Dagana is in the region of St. Louis.
"Dagana is a dividing line in terms of traveling on the road, but you can't give good administrative boundaries to the Delta sections because villages belong to different districts and even to Mauritania."
"Dagana is mostly rice cropping based, Podor is mostly onions and tomatoes."
Dagana is the limit of extension agencies' information and services.
"Beyond Dagana you get less information, less services, less NGOs."
"They resemble Dagana farmers in terms of rice intensity, but their practices are closer to Podor."
Upper and Lower Delta are divided by Ross Bethio.
Divisions are made by citing towns along the national road.
Richard Toll is outside the Lower Delta   it doesn't have the same irrigated scheme.
Big irrigated schemes are within the Lower Delta.
"If you are in the Upper Delta, there are different practices."
Some may crop rice and then tomatoes in cold/dry; some mostly oriented towards onions in the cold/dry.
"If you're in the Delta, in terms of cultivar, if it is the hot rice season, you may choose the short cycle cultivar depending on what time you're seeding."
Seeding time determines whether you choose long or short cycle cultivars.
"If you want to do a double cropping and you didn't start in February, then you have to choose a short cycle cultivar so you can prepare to crop before the end of the hot/dry going into the rainy season."
"There are influences from the market as well   if last season you weren't satisfied, you might not choose the same crop."
"Within rice, you have different cultivars   length of cycle, salinity, etc."
Then you have crop versus crop.
"If you are in a cold season and you are in Podor, most people will do onion."
It's the  onion zone.
"If you are in Dagana, where you have local tomato industry, people are mostly oriented towards tomatoes."
"In terms of variety (tomatoes/onions), you're choosing based on market demand (people will go to see what kind of rice people want)."
"Sahel 108, 201 are common rice varieties that people like, so seed producers make those."
"In Podor and Dagana, hot/dry is always for rice (in Podor there may be peanut too!)."
SAED table is of hectares cultivated.
Some people are suspicious of production numbers   they might be overestimated.
"But for the cropping area, it's likely to be accurate."
"Either way, SAED is the only option for getting data."
"In campaign years (e.g. this year), you'll probably exaggerate; outside of campaign years, the data are likely to be correct."
"If you go to the Delta zone, most of the millers are based in Upper Delta and so on."
Milling industry is unevenly distributed.
"Need market information   who's willing to buy, when and how."
"But that's not operational anymore, even if it's still needed."
"Aroma, length and brightness of rice is considered quality and preferred by high-income consumers."
This is 20% of the national demand.
But the majority of urban consumers prefer broken rice!
During the last five years there's been a shift to prefer local rice.
Before they didn't have a chance to try local rice because there wasn't enough to reach outside local markets to Dakar.
Now there's high promotion of local rice and people in the urban cities start liking local rice.
"There's a yearly meeting where all the farmers come to Dakar to sell their product, and that's a way that farmers from SRV can bring their local rice and gauge preference for it."
FIARA:
Farmer organization business day   come to Dakar for the week to present the crops they grow.
"The other way is, when you go to the seed producers, they're better informed in terms of market information."
They only produce the varieties that consumers want.
"Unfortunately, farmers don't have much information about preferences."
"The service to inform farmers about market preferences cost resources; ISRA had a program financed by USAID to promote local varieties, to gather online information and contact importers (sell local rice BEFORE importers, so importers want to know the type and quantity of rice available)."
But the financing is over!
"One of the programs in Naatal Mbay

There's still a need for farmers to get information about market conditions."
They tried giving price information through the telephone for Manobi.
Manobi used to be an online system for information about rice.
It's possible because everyone has their own phone.
Now we have e-advisors from ANCAR   ANCAR is developing this kind of tool.
"This is possible because the SRV farmers are more literate than, for example, the peanut basin."
"Men and women all have their own phones   though it's limited in rural cities, isn't true for all households, etc."
If there's one phone per household it belongs to the men.
"Some people might have to go 5 to 10 km to charge their phones with electricity, but they still have phones!"
Most people use Whatsapp.
Most of the time coops try to have a common cultivar throughout the season.
"Sometimes farmers go out on their own, but it's easiest to get all the farmers to go to one cultivar."
